        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[He reaches in a jagged hole torn in the roof of his vehicle, and he pulls out his wallet, a parking ticket and a Shinto good luck charm. He pockets them with a resigned smile — last month was his final car payment.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The Japanese tsunami left thousands of demolished cars in its wake. Cities  have ordered them removed in order to get on with cleanup, and they're  being stored in sprawling car graveyards up and down the battered  coastline.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[This man's story is a common one: He says he first tried to outrun the tsunami, but when he hit a traffic jam, he abandoned his vehicle with the keys still in the ignition and scrambled up the nearest hill.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[His totaled sedan was trucked to a sort-of cemetery for the automotive victims of the tsunami. The exposure to saltwater makes their parts useless for salvage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The vehicles are a frightful sight. They weren't merely swamped by rising water like so many cars in New Orleans after Katrina. These were seized by the onrushing water, then tossed and pummeled, wheels torn off and bodies ripped open as though by a rampaging monster.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Spring seems far from Tokyo's Ueno Park on a chilly Sunday under steely gray skies. Signs put up by the municipal government are scattered around the park, advising visitors not to picnic under the cherry blossoms, as is the national custom at this time of year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The idea is that people should be mourning the victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami, not celebrating the coming of spring.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The signs reflect the views of Tokyo's 78-year-old governor, Shintaro Ishihara, who is campaigning for a fourth term in this month's elections. Ishihara co-authored the 1989 book The Japan That Can Say No, in which he argues for a more assertive foreign policy, particularly toward the U.S. Ishihara recently apologized for remarks in which he said the tsunami was divine punishment for Japanese people's greed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[In spite of the signs, hundreds of people are picnicking or strolling in the park, although folks say things are slightly more subdued than usual.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Walking among the picnickers is Makku Akasaka. With recorded music and a bottle of sake, he's out campaigning as the sole candidate of the obscure "Smile Party."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[He says he disagrees with the governor's injunctions against hanami or cherry-blossom viewing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Refrain[ing] from entertainment, including hanami, is a negative mind," he insists, dressed in a furry hat. "Most important thing for Japanese people is to rebuild, and so they need [a] positive mind."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Hanami, Japanese will tell you, is an expression of the aesthetic sensibility in the Japanese soul. Or, at least, it's a very popular sort of affectation, says magazine editor Yoshi Tsujimura.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Even if you're just there to have fun and enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms," he says, "it's a part of Japanese people's character that they have to appreciate it — or at least act like they appreciate on a level beyond mere physical beauty."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[In one part of Ueno Park, Tokyo resident Hitomi Onishi and two girlfriends are playing karuta, a favorite hanami game in which players take turns reciting poems from a deck of cards.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[She reads the famous verses of 9th-century court poet Tomonori Kino:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Flower petals fall restlessly]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[There is no peace in my heart.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"/>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Nearby, schoolteacher Masujio Shimozaki sits on a tarp under the overhead explosion of pink and white cherry blossoms. He's enjoying some sushi, cheese and whiskey with four friends.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Shimozaki says he doesn't need governor Ishihara's civics lessons about how to respond to natural disasters.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["I'm the sort of person that, if you tell me to look right, I look left," he harrumphs. "It's important to have a diversity of opinions. But we definitely brought less food than in years past. We're trying to conserve in our own way, while still enjoying each others' company."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[He mentions hakanasa, one of several Japanese words to describe human sensitivity to the poignant fact that cherry blossoms, like life and beauty themselves, are short-lived, and that nature produces tsunamis as well as spring blossoms.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["I think beauty and pain exist together and can't be separated," he muses. "When you look at the cherry blossoms, there's hakanasa in their beauty."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Japanese point to 17th-century haiku master Basho as someone who wrote about acceptance — or transcendence — of the mingling of beauty and sadness. Many of his later works are characterized by karumi, a Buddhist-influenced sense of lightness and detachment, sketched in this poem:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The three brothers who make up Los Lonely Boys each bring their own personality to their Tejano-inflected rock and country songs. In conversation, however, they speak almost as if with one voice — constantly finishing each each other's sentences, letting one story flow seamlessly into another.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[As they tell Weekend Edition guest host David Greene, fraternal harmony runs deep in their family: Their father, Ringo Garza Sr., was in a band with his own brothers called The Falcones, and made a point of bringing up his sons in a musical house.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["Our father was our biggest influence," says bassist Jojo Garza. "He showed us all kinds of music — of his music, as well as the music of a lot of the greats."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"/>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Those greats included the likes of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Three Dog Night, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. Nelson is also a family friend — the brothers have even golfed with him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["He's just a person you want to be around at all times," says guitarist Henry Garza. "He's much like our dad in the way we feel around him. Our dad has always been the missing outlaw to Willie, Waylon, Kris Kristofferson and those guys."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[On the new album Rockpango, the trio, which also includes drummer Ringo Garza Jr., seems to wear its influences on its sleeve: "16 Monkeys" has clear echoes of the Beatles' "Taxman," and the guitar on "Love In My Veins" is Santana all over. Henry Garza says it's not an accident.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["When we're recording, I think we all try to channel our heroes and teachers," he says. "I definitely am trying to tap into Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, Stevie Ray [Vaughan]."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The group has been through tough times together, on stage and off. Most recently, Jojo Garza sustained a vocal cord injury that made him constantly raspy and threatened to grow worse the more he used his voice. He and his brothers feared that he might never talk again, let alone sing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Thankfully, he pulled through the ordeal. Henry Garza says Jojo's vocals on the Rockpango track "Smile" will always remind him of those difficult days and the joy he felt when they came to an end.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Nevada leads the nation in foreclosures. In Las   Vegas, banks are repossessing record numbers of homes. But the flip side is that for some low-income buyers, home ownership is finally within reach.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Lady Luck has smiled on David Krueger, a waiter at the glitzy Mirage Hotel who earns $13 an hour, plus tips. That's about $30,000 a year. His partner makes less.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Krueger recently bought a three-bedroom house for $115,000. From some of the windows, he can look west and see mountains. His 15-year-old is a big reason Krueger bought the home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["It shows him that working hard will pay off and you can have something nice," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Nearby, many of the houses stand empty. But windows aren't boarded up, and the neighborhood seems more low-key than deserted. The empty homes didn't keep Krueger away, because to him, owning is better than renting.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I work hard for a living, and I want my payment to go to something that's going to belong to me, and not belong to somebody else," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Down Payment Help]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Despite his salary, Krueger was able to get a loan because he has good credit. He also qualified for a federal program that helps low-income home buyers. The purchase is especially sweet because Krueger himself knows the pain of foreclosure. In 2006, his partner bought the family a home, using a risky, adjustable-rate loan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Our payments went up, almost double, and we had paid nothing on our home," he says. "We didn't understand the rates and what was going on."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[The payments overwhelmed them; eventually, the bank foreclosed. But Krueger's credit was clean. This time, he turned to a nonprofit organization called Nevada Partners, which helps members of the big Vegas hotel union buy homes. It gave Krueger $4,000 toward his down payment.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["It is a loan. But there's no interest on it, and there's no monthly payments on that loan," says Julio Jimenez, who runs the loan program.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The program has helped almost 400 families since it began two years ago — that's a lot of waiters and maids who would still be renting. Some families have received as much as $20,000. Jimenez says they don't have to pay back the loan until they sell or refinance.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["The union decided to start putting this program together when the housing boom was still pretty high," Jimenez said. "They wanted to help workers to achieve homeownership because it was difficult to get low- to moderate-income families into a home."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Low Prices]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Prices are so low these days that some workers are able to buy homes even without outside help — homes they never could have afforded a few years ago without a dodgy loan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Lorena Resendiz, a waitress and single mother, recently made a down payment on a $115,000 home in a gated community north of town.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["I saved my money for a long time," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[She and her 8-year-old daughter just moved into the three-bedroom house.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["It made me feel more stronger, happy, more secure," she says. "So I feel so good."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[And lucky. During the real estate bubble, Resendiz almost bought a $250,000 home, but she got cold feet and backed out the night before signing the papers. After that, she gave up hope of ever owning her own home, but then found this one. It cost half what she would have paid during the bubble.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In the weeks following the tsunami, there have been relatively few documented reports of thievery in the devastated coastal cities of northeastern Japan. That's in contrast to widespread looting that has been reported after natural disasters in other countries.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[To find out why, we visit the town of Kamaishi, where the black tide killed at least 600 people, threw an ocean freighter onto the wharf and blew open thousands of houses and shops, leaving many things to steal.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[There have been media reports of limited looting elsewhere: an ATM pried open, gas siphoned from disabled vehicles, stolen food, water and beer. What about in this town?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["We have some reports, confirmed reports, that some money or bicycles were stolen from the house or shops. We confirmed it's not washed away by the tsunami, but somebody else did it," says Hironori Kodashima, the vice police chief. He's standing in front  of the   temporary police station, wearing a plain blue worksuit because  his uniform   was washed away.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["But the number is less than 10 so far," he says. That's fewer than 10 reports in a city that was home to 40,000 people, though he says there could be more.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Just then, a woman walks into the police station holding a soggy wallet. It has the equivalent of $150 in it. I ask a policewoman if this is common.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Actually, we get a lot because lots of wallets are washed away, so lots of them are found," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[My translator and I want to find out if local people have heard about any burglaries after the tsunami. I remember some of the Hurricane Katrina survivors in New Orleans who hauled off liquor bottles, Nike sneakers and flat-screen TVs. But Japanese speak of their culture of shame, haji, which frowns on committing an act that would disgrace one's family.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[In Kamaishi, about half of the 15 people we talk to over the course of the day say they haven't heard of any looting. The other half say they've heard of other people's homes or shops being broken into, but it hasn't happened to them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Some say they heard there was a lot of stealing in the seaside village  of Unosumai, which is 10 minutes away, so we go there.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The scene is even worse than in Kamaishi: utter obliteration. The contents of happy homes litter the gray sand: a broken teacup, a futon, a mahjong tile, a statue of a smiling Buddha. The only sound in this wasteland is a ghostly announcement by the local government for free hot baths.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[What about thievery here? It's the same story as in Kamaishi: People have heard vaguely about burglars, but no one has firsthand knowledge. The only actual sighting here was by my translator, Chie Kobayashi. She says she saw two young men carry some toilet paper and other items out of a shattered drug store when she was here about a week ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[By the end of the day, the we have one concrete crime report: Tetsuhiko Kikuchi, a 68-year-old dry cleaner, says someone stole some food from his apartment the day after the tsunami. A few days later, he came to check on his place and found some valuables missing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["The necklaces and watches — all small stuff," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But people are clearly worried. They're patrolling their own neighborhoods. There's a rumor circulating that the thieves are gaikokujin — foreigners.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Pernicious rumors in the aftermath of great disasters in this country have a historic precedent. After the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923, rumors that foreigners were poisoning wells and committing arson and robbery led to the mass murders of Koreans by Japanese mobs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[If anyone would know whether there are thieves about, it's the shobodan, the ubiquitous blue-jacketed volunteer firemen who patrol the city every night. In Kamaishi, their chief is Matsuo Wada, a stern 67-year-old retired city councilman.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[No, he says, they haven't encountered a single looter.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["Kamaishi is a very safe city," he says. "We have received information that there are foreigners walking around committing crimes." He raises his eyebrows skeptically. "I cannot tell you if it's true or not."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Some young female musicians in Belgium experienced a small career change one day, when their classical choir morphed into a rock cover band. Conducted by Stijn Kolacny and accompanied on piano by his brother Steven, the group collectively known as Scala & Kolacny Brothers has built a career on transforming rock radio hits into otherworldly choral pieces.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Scala & Kolacny Brothers had its breakout moment in the U.S. this past year, when its cover of Radiohead's "Creep" was featured in the trailer for the film The Social Network. The choir's reinterpretation transforms the song's self-loathing lyrics into something sweeter, but as Steven Kolacny tells Morning Edition guest host Linda Wertheimer, lyrics weren't the group's main focus.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["The most important thing is the mood. We tried to find another mood, another feeling ... something completely different," Kolacny says. He adds that the group's philosophy when choosing songs is all about finding styles that contrast with its own. "If you go to the more popular songs like Madonna or Michael Jackson, I don't think that will work for Scala. But if you go to Metallica, Muse, Radiohead, maybe even more alternative rock sounds like Marilyn Manson, that works very well."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Kolacny says Radiohead was a key part of the once-classical ensemble's transition to rock covers, which came about after a friend gave him a CD with some of the band's live recordings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["My question was, how is it possible that a choir these days is not able to sing rock music?" he asks. The answer, Kolacny says, was easy: "There are no scores — that's it. You need somebody making the right scores of the right songs for the right choir."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The group does have a few originals in its catalog. One standout track from its new self-titled album is "Seashell," whose organ riffs and bouncy rhythms recall another European group: ABBA. Stijn Kolacny says it's all part of Scala's mission to entertain above all else.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["I think there is [enough misery] in the world," he says. "When people come to a show and listen to Scala, it's great that they're moved or that they smile and step out of a venue and are happy. Maybe only for a moment — but we did our job."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Native Americans intermarry at higher rates than any other group in the country, according to U.S. Census data.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[For the Eastern Shoshone of Wyoming, you have to be at least one-quarter Native American to be a tribal member. That requirement could mean a loss of both population and identity. And intermarriage can also lead to a loss of federal benefits.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Amanda LeClair met Martin Antonio Diaz when one of LeClair's sorority sisters introduced them three years ago. At the time, LeClair was getting her bachelor's degree at the University of Wyoming and Diaz was working at a local restaurant.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Well, when Martin first met me he thought I was Mexican; and so he was really like, 'Why don't you speak Spanish?' and I was like, 'I just don't, why are you asking me that?' " says LeClair.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Diaz's family calls Jalisco, Mexico, home. LeClair grew up on Wyoming's Wind River Indian Reservation and is an enrolled Shoshone tribal member. That means she meets the blood requirement to be a Shoshone citizen. After the couple dated for a while, Diaz says things got more serious.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["She kept staying more and more and more regularly and we finally decided, 'Why don't we just get our own place and see how things work out?' and so far so good," says Diaz.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[They have discussed marriage, kids and the future, but here's the rub: LeClair is half Shoshone. If she has children with Diaz, their children will be only one-quarter Native American. That's the minimum amount of blood required to be enrolled in the Shoshone tribe. Therefore, if their children marry someone nonnative as well, the grandchildren would technically not be Indians. It's an issue that troubles LeClair.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Because I'm not going to teach them, you know, 'You need to marry a Native person because after a quarter your kids can't be enrolled,' and I don't want to teach them that," says LeClair. "But I have wondered, is that going to be an issue? Or am I going to feel kind of sad if they end up having kids with somebody else?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[There's a high chance that will happen. More than half of all Native Americans don't marry other natives. By way of comparison, according to census data, nearly 95 percent of whites marry other white people, and more than 85 percent of African-Americans marry other black people.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[David Wilkins, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of  Minnesota, says that intermarriage has always been the norm. "It just shows that Native individuals, due to the small population size of most indigenous communities, frequently find that they have to reach outside of their local community to find a partner suitable for marriage — hence the high degree of intermarriage," says Wilkins.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[But there are consequences to intermarrying, according to Debra Donahue, a professor of Indian law at the University of  Wyoming.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["The protections and benefits that do go to tribal members or to people who qualify as Indians on the federal side can be significant," says Donahue.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[This becomes significant because it can affect child custody cases, access to free health care, education and land ownership. For many tribes, continuing high rates of intermarriage could become a huge issue in the future, since to remain as fully functioning nations, with governments, they need to have a population, says Donahue.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["But if a tribe were concerned about losing population, they could adjust their membership requirements to ensure that they maintain membership," says Donahue." But that's really a cultural choice for the tribe to make."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Many have changed their requirements. For instance, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma allows anyone who can prove he is a tribal descendant to become a citizen. However, this leniency has proved problematic. Some say many Cherokee members are not culturally or genetically affiliated with the tribe anymore.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Despite the numbers, blood requirements and federal regulations, Amanda LeClair says that being Indian is more than blood, it's culture, and that is something Diaz is embracing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["It is nice. For me I really appreciate that they teach me a lot about their culture or take me to ceremonies or their events that they have up there," Diaz says. "So that's really nice."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"/>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["I think if he wasn't as understanding maybe you would see it as marrying out, but since he is really respectful and he's willing to listen and willing to learn, I think it's more incorporating," LeClair says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[When LeClair thinks of her future children and grandchildren, she says knowing the culture and having someone to love is more important than having a tribal identification card.  [Copyright 2011 Wyoming Public Radio Network]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In Chicago last school year, 245 public school students were shot, 27 of them fatally.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[It's a high toll. To try to find out who might be next, Chicago  Public School officials developed a probability model by analyzing the traits of 500 shooting victims over a recent two-year period. They noted that the vast majority were poor, black and male, and had chronic absences, bad grades and serious misconduct.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Using this probability model, they identified more than 200 teenagers who have a shockingly good chance of being shot — a better than 1 in 5 chance within the next two years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Project Director Jonathan Moy says the probability model isn't perfect, but it's working.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Approximately half of the victims who have been shot this year were identified using the probability model," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[To reduce those awful odds, the school system is now assigning paid mentors to the teens identified to be most at risk of becoming victims of gun violence. Under the $20 million program, adult mentors counsel the teenagers in and out of school, help them find jobs and try to teach them life skills that can steer them away from violence. It's one of the most ambitious mentoring programs in the country.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Daily Fights]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Albert Stinson, 38, walks through the lunchroom at his alma mater, Marshall High School on Chicago's West Side, greeting boys wearing Marshall uniforms — maroon polo shirts and khaki pants. "Hey! What's up boy? How you feeling, boy? Whatcha doing, yo?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Stinson says he checks up on his mentees regularly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["They was a part of that big gang fight last year, so I always gotta come see what's going on in the lunchroom," he says. "Sometime I wanna make sure my guys ain't into no type of squabble or things like that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Gangs are a big problem here: Stinson says there are fights almost every day.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Most of the 10 boys Stinson mentors at Marshall are affiliated with gangs and have criminal records. They're not in that ultra high-risk category of having a 1 in 5 chance of being shot, but they are at serious risk for becoming victims of violence.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Stinson says he's looking for signs that his boys might be agitated or angry.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["If when I go up to them and ask them how they're doing, it's a certain look," he says. "Just from being in the neighborhood, you know it. If somebody's looking a certain way, you're kind of like, 'They in more of an aggressive mode.'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Back in the classroom that serves as the mentors' office, the solidly built Stinson says the fact that he's from this neighborhood and graduated from Marshall 20 years ago gives him credibility with the teens.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I have the same background. I was them. And that's one thing I use to my advantage because I know what it feels to be affiliated in the court system," he says. "But I also know what it feels like to grow and that's what I'm getting them to look at when they set visionary goals — that you can grow from the dirt that's out there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Stinson says the teenagers he works with often can't see a future. As he puts it, they "only see what's across the street," and almost everything they see is negative.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[The teens NPR talked to at Marshall say it's often hard to find positive things to do and positive people to be around — and that's especially true of the men in their lives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[As someone once on the wrong path himself, Stinson says he is very aware of the lack of good role models in these boys' lives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I think that we do a bad job and I apologize to all of my mentees," he says. "As black men, we have failed them, because of examples we put out there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Raw And Explosive Anger]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[When NPR followed Stinson at Marshall earlier this school year, he was  meeting with his boys almost every day at school. Now, he focuses on visiting  with them after school and at home. He goes to court with them and checks in with  their probation officers and teachers. He's also trying to help them find  part-time jobs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[It's the kind of attention 17-year-old Antonio Fox, one of Stinson's newest mentees, is just warming up to.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"/>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["You need a person to talk to before you do something stupid," Fox says. "You need a mentor or somebody on your side who will say something: 'Man, don't do this, don't do that.' Sometimes, you ain't gonna listen but you gotta listen so you don't get in trouble."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Antonio has been in trouble quite a bit. He was kicked out of school for fighting, but has been back since October. He's on probation and lives with an aunt because his mother "did something stupid."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[He says he's seen plenty of street violence: an uncle's head bashed in by a crowbar, a rival shot down who's now in a coma.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[And he admits to provoking many fights himself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[But Antonio says he knows how fistfights can quickly escalate to gunbattles, and says he doesn't want to be a part of it anymore.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["I wanna live to see everything," he says. "My kids grow up, their kids grow up. I wanna see all that, I wanna see them graduate and go to college. I wanna see them be more than who I am."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[But just an hour or so later, Antonio is out in the hallway, picking a fight.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["Where's my money, man!" he yells. "Where my money at, man!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Stinson runs out to try to calm him down: "Tonio! Hey! Tonio! You don't have to be like that!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[Antonio's anger is raw and explosive — and Stinson has his hands full.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA["You don't have to disrespect a brother like that, Tonio, because it's not that serious about $2, Tonio!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[No punches are thrown, but the shouting continues for more than 10 minutes, and Antonio is still furious.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Stinson eventually calms him down and walks Antonio to class.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA["You gonna be good, man?" Stinson asks. "Yeah, you smiling, man. Go into class, man!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[As he walks away, Stinson says this of Antonio: "He be all right. I trust him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[Later, though, Stinson notes how dangerous Antonio's explosive rage could have been — and that if this fight had been on the street, it could have been deadly. Stinson says the boys he's mentoring only know how to react in the worst way.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA["It's basically like we've got to recondition them because they were never shown certain life skills," Stinson says. "And that's the unfortunate part because when they're not shown certain life skills, they just react. It's no critical thinking in that because they've never been shown how to sit down and try to think things through because everything is so reactionary. So you have to put in so much work and it's a process."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[Signs Of Success]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[With some of the guys he's mentoring though, Stinson says he is seeing signs of progress. He sees them taking more accountability for their actions, and he says some are more aware of and trying to avoid what Stinson calls the traps facing young black males.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA["Brother D, this young fella got something to tell you," Stinson says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[And at the end of the day, Antonio is back to mumble an apology. "Hey, I got outta line with you, man," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[At Marshall and at other Chicago Public High Schools where mentors are working with almost 1,700 teenagers most at risk for becoming  victims of gun violence, there are other signs of success. The mentored teens  are attending school more often and getting into a lot less trouble. School  officials say attendance for students with mentors is up almost 10 percent and  serious behavioral incidents are down 34 percent.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA[And officials  say outside of school, significantly fewer students have been shot than at this  point last year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="48"><![CDATA[It's not all  good news though. One of the 10 boys Stinson started mentoring at Marshall back in the fall is now behind bars.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="49"><![CDATA[Citywide,  nearly half of the kids school officials identified as being at  ultra high risk for becoming victims of gun violence didn't even get into the  mentoring program. Some dropped out, moved and couldn't be found; some are  incarcerated; some refused to participate or their parents refused to give  consent; and, yes, for a few it was too late — they'd already been shot.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Youth violence rates around the country have been decreasing in recent years, but violent crimes are still most concentrated in poorer, urban neighborhoods. Experts say kids who grow up in dangerous areas are more likely to become targets.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In Chicago, a program called CeaseFire is working to curb violence by helping at-risk youth find employment and patrolling the streets to stop crimes before they happen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Shooting And Getting Shot At]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Deyontaye Brooms is a small 17-year-old with a quick, winning smile, and a close-cropped haircut. The high school junior lives with his mother and stepfather, and has seven siblings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Broom's school, Fenger Academy in Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, gained notoriety a few years ago when cell phone video of the beating death of another student several blocks from the school went viral on the Internet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Brooms says Roseland is a rough neighborhood.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["It's a lot of shooting everyday. I got shot at once upon a time. My friends also got shot at and shot," he says. "I was just lucky that I ain't got shot."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Brooms says he might be lucky because he's now involved with CeaseFire.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[At the Roseland CeaseFire office, Brooms talks openly about his young life. He's on probation for getting into a fight with a school security guard. When he was on the verge of getting kicked out of school, Brooms says, CeaseFire helped prevent it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Brooms says he's familiar with the violence in his community because he was often a part of it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I was in a gang. It happens," he says. "You know, I used to be out here robbing people, shooting at people, breaking in their houses. I was doing everything I could to get the money, selling drugs and everything. Everything."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Brooms says those days are over now. He says the gangbanging and crime started because his mother was struggling and he needed things like money and fashionable shoes — things he couldn't get from home. With no job opportunities for a youngster, Brooms says, he joined a gang when he was about 11 or 12.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["I needed the gun because it's best for me to have mine while they've got theirs," Brooms says. "It's not like I wanted to shoot at people for fun because I'd rather fight than use a gun. But nowadays people don't want to use hands. They don't want to fight; they want to use a gun."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"/>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Coping Mechanisms]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[University of Chicago researcher Dexter Voisin studies how youth on Chicago's south side cope with community violence. He says teens growing up in dangerous neighborhoods have a range of coping strategies.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[They seek out nonviolent friends, some become resigned, others strive to do well in school and some cope by fighting.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Voisin says part of the "code of survival on the streets" is to retaliate.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[He says youth begin to think, "If I don't retaliate, it's just a matter of time before I'm dead."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Voisin says he thinks "the coping mechanisms for some boys are the same coping mechanisms that are also putting them in harms way in terms of homicide trends."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[For Brooms, having a gun makes him feel safe.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["I feel like something could happen. Ain't like I walk around every day with it. I don't want to go to jail at all and I ain't got no time to be going to jail trying to get somebody up off me," he says. "Never had to kill nobody in my life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Brooms says he's also never harmed anyone with a gun, as far as he knows, but he has lost a couple of friends to gunfire, so he understands when people seek revenge.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["Crying over your man's coffin and everything makes you want to get at anybody," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Brooms says he understands the street life, but still, he says he's been working hard to change.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["I ain't selling drugs no more. I'm not fighting no more. I'm not reckless no more," he says. "Plus I got people in my ear telling me like, 'Man, you don't need to do that, that's the same thing I used to do when I was young and I'm like, all right.'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Experts Say Jobs Curb Violence]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[The Justice Department calls CeaseFire's strategy effective. It found that the group's interventions in risky neighborhoods and its work with gang members has helped decrease shootings and killings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[But Harold Pollack, co-director of the crime lab at the University of Chicago, says there's also a broader public policy challenge that needs to be addressed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["The best thing we could do for many of these young people to keep them out of crime is make sure they have a job," Pollack says.  "In this current economic climate, not enough politicians, particularly in Washington, appreciate the importance of that. When we are trying to get money for summer jobs for Chicago youth, it's a heavy lift in Washington to get those kinds of resources."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Brooms hopes CeaseFire can help him find some type of work. He still has some problems at school but his grades have improved and he says despite some of the violent stories that have made headline news, some of the violence prevention efforts in Roseland do seem to be working.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["Right now it's not really hectic like it used to be. Right now it's kind of quiet where I'm at," he says. "You don't hear any shooting or anything. It's a nice little minute. A nice little minute."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Now, Brooms says all he wants to do is just make it in life. He's going to try to make his high school football team and hopefully play football in college. He's already chosen where he wants to go to school.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Part 2 of a two-part series]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Tourists pass through Guayaquil, Ecuador, on their way to the Galapagos. What they don't see are thousands of street children, who have fled home to escape abuse or just to earn enough money to survive. Social service organizations there say once kids have lived on their own for too long, it can be impossible to reunite them with their families.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But for one group known as JUCONI, family reunification is essential. In Guayaquil's slums, there are few street signs and fewer addresses. So it's easy to understand why, once again, Sylvia Reyes is lost. She drives back and forth over the same muddy streets, peering through the rain on her windshield.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Reyes is the founder of an ambitious effort to help street children and their families: It's called JUCONI, a Spanish acronym for "Junto con los Ninos," or "Together with the Children."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Helping The Hopeless]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[She and her colleague Martha Espinoza are meeting with a family that was once so troubled, Reyes wondered whether they could be helped. In fact, Reyes admits they were "a terrible family when we started — a very, very violent family."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Finally, Reyes finds the home of Angela Angulo and her children. In the slum known as Guasmo, their home is one of the nicer ones. It is sparsely furnished but spacious and neat.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[This once-terrible family looks rather peaceful. Angulo smiles warmly as she introduces her three beautiful children: Kelly is 8 years old, Moises is 11 and Michelle is 13. The oldest, 17-year-old Jorge Luis, is not around.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Music from a neighboring house shakes the walls as Angulo talks about how she met JUCONI: It began six years ago, when the family was in dire straits.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I had no hope," she says. "We were very poor. I was a child in the body of a woman without self-esteem. My kids were not in school. My husband didn't have a job."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Her oldest, Jorge Luis, was just 11 at the time. To help earn money, he would sneak out of the house to sell sodas on the street. He'd proudly bring home groceries, trying to replace his father as the breadwinner.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[But instead of praising him, Angulo would beat Jorge Luis. She could not love him because he was the product of a horrible trauma.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["When I was 18, I was gang-raped," Angulo says. Her body begins to shake and tears start to flow. "For a long time I was terrified of life. I was terrified of my own past. And all of that made me emotionally weak. I couldn't live with myself."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The memory is still incredibly painful, but Angulo says working with JUCONI has made her stronger.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[A Long Process]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[One of the tools JUCONI uses is game-playing. Espinoza, the family's main therapist, pours out a sack of plastic animals. Each person picks one. Angulo is a horse, the children pick a lion for the father, who is not here. It's a chance for the younger kids to get engaged and speak about what kind of family they would like to be.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Over six years, JUCONI has seen a lot of progress. The father now has a job, and the children are in school. The violence is gone. But mother and son can barely stand one another. Jorge Luis tells us his mother used to beat him terribly. He says he is not ready to forgive her, at least not yet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[JUCONI's methods are designed to reach families that other programs cannot help. Reyes says more money is only part of the problem, pointing out that some poor families in Ecuador can take care of themselves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["So there might be a health center there, and they use that health center," she says, "whereas with our families, they can be next-door to a health center and they won't go there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[JUCONI never gives up on a family. That's one reason why this group can only take on a limited number of cases: The process takes a lot of time.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The Most In Need]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Grace Mora and her family have successfully completed JUCONI's program. When JUCONI first met them, alcohol was ruining their lives, and the children were living with relatives. One son was working on the streets. Today, they still struggle financially, but now Mora beams about her family and about their future.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[JUCONI helped persuade Mora's husband to give up drinking. The eldest son was a street kid when JUCONI found him. Now he is at the university, studying civil engineering. His first task when he graduates, he says, will be to tear down his family's cracked and broken house and build a new one.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[JUCONI is housed is a modest building in downtown Guayaquil. Volunteers and trained therapists come and go wearing colorful aprons marked "JUCONI." They provide a small measure of protection against the gangs who run these neighborhoods.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Reyes says when she started here 10 years ago, she just wanted to get as many kids off the streets as possible. Now, she is focused on developing a method that will work for families anywhere who are most in need.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["That's what we're trying to design," she says. "It's something which means it doesn't matter how impossible your life situation is, you can be helped."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Reyes has training in psychology and relies heavily on outside experts in family development. Many come from the U.S. and Europe at their own expense to help her improve her work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[She tracks the outcomes of her families with files that document progress toward pre-established goals, like whether there is still abuse in the family, and if there is still emotional mistreatment of the kids.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Reproducing Their Efforts]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Reyes has an unusual mix of skills and attributes that guide her through her work with vulnerable families. She grew up bicultural, with a Mexican father and an English mother. Her husband is the Ecuadoran consul to the U.K. — for the past two years the couple and their two children have lived in London, and she runs JUCONI long-distance and with frequent visits. The British Embassy and the European Commission are major donors to JUCONI.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[As much as she still loves this program, Reyes is trying to pull out of day-to-day operations of the Guayaquil project and focus on reproducing her success in other countries. She says Turkey is interested.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[She says the surprising thing is that these families actually let an outsider share their darkest secrets.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["We begin by giving them a level of attention and focus on them they've never received from anybody before," she says, "so actually it's a really easy sell."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[But Reyes says her approach is not always an easy sell to donors. They want to see clear, short-term results. And social scientists in the U.S. say reuniting troubled, abusive families can be risky and time-consuming. But they also say the alternative, foster care, can be even more harmful to children.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[At night, Reyes and JUCONI workers go on the prowl looking for kids. This is another signature of this program's approach. Sure enough, they find Susana, an 8-year-old, dressed in fashionably thin jeans. She is selling flowers to passersby. Suzanna tells us she and her brother often work past midnight in the clubs and restaurant here.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Suzanna and her brother know they should be working, but when the JUCONI staff pull out some games and puzzles, the kids are hungry for play. They only stop when their mother arrives and tells them to get back to work. On another night, JUCONI will approach the mother to see whether she will accept their help.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It's dinner time at the House of Blessings and Longevity, a nursing home in Japan's Iwate prefecture. Seniors eat their tofu and rice while documentary footage of past tsunamis airs on the television.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Daisuke Hirata, the manager of another nursing home in nearby Ofunato city, is looking after nine of his elderly residents who were brought here to Oshu city after the tsunami damaged his facility. Hirata still looks shocked as he recalls the seniors' reactions when the powerful quake hit.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["Some people hid under tables," he remembers. "Those suffering dementia couldn't understand what was happening. They just squatted down or covered their heads with cushions."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Once the shaking stopped, nine caregivers and 23 seniors, some of them in wheelchairs, headed for an assembly hall on high ground. Hirata went back to the nursing home to turn off the gas and batten down the hatches before returning to the hall. That's when he saw the tsunami coming.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["It rose up and sloshed around like water boiling in a pot," he says, gesturing to describe the turbulence. "Unlike normal waves, the tsunami kicked up huge amounts of spray. It was like a scene from a movie. Houses were creaking as the tsunami crushed them together."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Of 67 seniors in another part of his facility, 13 managed to escape, Hirata says. The rest were killed by the tsunami.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Initial reports from parts of northeast Japan devastated by this month's earthquake and tsunami suggest that elderly residents account for a disproportionate number of the disaster's victims.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Risk Factors Include Mobility, Lifestyle, Psychology]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Besides being one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, Japan has a population with the world's longest life expectancy. Confucian concepts of respect for parents and ancestors are still strong, and the country's laws put the responsibility for taking care of aging parents squarely on their children. In northeast Japan, the median age of residents in many communities is over 50, as younger residents leave to find work in the big cities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Keiko Yoshizawa, who runs the House of Blessings and Longevity, says large government subsidies cover 90 percent of the cost of institutions like hers, while families pick up the remaining 10 percent. Demand for care of the elderly, she says, far outstrips the supply.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["We have 500 people on the waiting list here," she confides. "In all of Japan, there are 400,000 people on waiting lists for nursing homes. Our waiting list is three times the capacity of our facility."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Most of the nearly 6,500 people killed in the 1995 Kobe earthquake were elderly, says Noritoshi Tanida, a scholar at the Yamaguchi Graduate School of Medicine in southern Japan. Seniors' lack of mobility is not the only reason for this, he says. Lifestyles and psychology are also factors. For example, older Japanese tend to live in more fragile wooden houses. They often prefer to live on the first floor, where they are more easily killed by collapsing buildings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["In emergency shelters," he says, "elderly people tend not to express their needs for food and water. When that happens, they can get dehydrated more easily than younger people."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA['Just Destined To Live Through These Things']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Hisaho Koseki, 82, barely escaped the tsunami when a neighbor drove her to safety. Now she sits among piles of blankets and boxes of donuts at a local evacuation center. Koseki has a bright smile and happily chats with visitors. But she says the disaster has left her homeless, and she's afraid of being kicked out of the shelter. Her son has offered to take her in, but she doesn't want to burden him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I have chronic ailments, and I don't know how much longer I'll live," she frets. "I don't want to die, but in this situation, perhaps it would be better if I did."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Koseki has survived worse calamities than this one. During World War II, she worked in Tokyo as allied bombing raids turned the capital into a sea of flames. She says many colleagues just did not show up for work in the mornings at her electronics factory.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["I asked about them and was told they were killed," she recollects. "It was a military factory, so I think the Americans specifically targeted us. The war was scary, but we couldn't do anything about it. Now this tsunami has happened. I guess I was just destined to live through these things."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Koseki says her body is covered with the scars of her many past operations. But she promises to keep on living — with strength — for as long as she can.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Coalition airstrikes have pushed forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi back to the outskirts of Ajdabiya in the East — just south of the rebel capital,  Benghazi.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But, so far, the anti-Gadhafi rebels have been unable to do much to  capitalize on the opportunity, and remain largely pinned down on the roadway  south of Benghazi.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The main roadway southwest out of Benghazi toward the front is littered with the  ruins of some of Gadhafi's heavy armor — destroyed rocket  launchers, tanks and transport buses lie scattered and smoldering in the desert  next to the road. In one spot, someone has hung tattered uniform tops from  Gadhafi's soldiers from metal fence posts, like green scarecrows. There's  still a smell of burning metal and rubber.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[There's an armored personal carrier smoking and charred in the field next to two blown-off turrets of a Russian made artillery. Kids play on them,  as locals take photos. The carnage and destruction  from the allied air strikes has become a kind of tourist site along the road  between Benghazi and Ajdabiya.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Look at what Gadhafi is doing with our country's wealth," says Mohammed Khalifa, 68. "He's buying weapons to attack own  people! He has no mercy!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Ahmed Jarbou, 45, a businessman from Benghazi, drove out with his wife  and young daughter to see the destruction first hand. He stands next to a  massive artillery piece that this past weekend had rained terror down on  Benghazi.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Jarbou cradles a sawed-off shotgun in one arm — and his 2-year-old  daughter Jude in the other.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Two days she's crying after the booms at home," he says. "[Gadhafi] is  crazy. How any people can [he] kill ... by this one, by this machine? Kids and  women, and men — and he's looking for al-Qaida? No, these are Benghazi  people."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Nearby, rebel fighter Mohammed El Gizeery is showing his 60-year-old mother Hahdiya  around the destruction. He's driven her here in his beat up old Opel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[We saw Gadhafi's attacks and the airstrikes, she  says, and we were not afraid — God protected us. We thank Europe and America for  their help and support and, God willing, we'll now be victorious, she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[But a half-hour up the desert road from this spot, rebel fighters near the front line  are not as confident. They've been unable, so far, to make much progress at  all. They keep getting pushed back when they try to fight forward into  Ajdabiya.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The entrance to the city is still guarded by Gadhafi's tanks and  heavy artillery. Fighter Fathi Belas, 36, left his elementary school  teaching job in Shahat, a town some 200 miles to the east, to take to the fight.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["We still need everything," Belas says, "heavy weapons,  night-vision goggles. We have no proper communication network."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Nearby, 22-year-old fighter Sanad el Hassi is resting in his pickup  truck, with his AK-47 by his side.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["We have a huge difference in forces," Hassi says of Gadhafi's firepower. "He has more heavy  weapons and ammunition than we do; he still has tanks, grad rockets,  and artillery," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["We're  worried about our brothers in Misrata," Hassi says of rebels under siege in that  city far to the west. Witnesses there say more than 40 civilians have  been killed in the last two days.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Rebel  officials say some of Gadhafi's troops using heavy armor tried again to  push into Benghazi Monday night — this time from the east. They were stopped by  allied airstrikes, they say. It's very possible that one of the  planes halting that attack was the U.S. F15-Eagle fighter that crashed in the  Libyan desert Monday night. Both pilots, the military says, ejected from that plane and are now  safe.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Egyptian doctors who treated one of the pilots said this man was taken to  a hotel in Benghazi around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning by rebel sympathizers. Dr. Dina  Omar says she was surfing the Web late at her hotel when she got the word that  a U.S. pilot needed attention. She says he wouldn't give his name or any  information — he wouldn't talk much at all at first.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[But slowly, she says, he  became less anxious after realizing he really was in supportive hands.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["After two hours  he started to speak and smile, he even said I have to trust you because if you're  with Gadhafi or other side you're good actor for me," she says. "I guess he felt comfortable with us."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The  pilot, she says, suffered only minor bruises. Omar says she went to sleep  around 5 a.m. — and the pilot left with the help from members of the rebel's  Provisional National Council.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[It's not clear how he was whisked out of Libya. It appears the  other pilot was rescued, and Britain's Channel 4 News reports that six villagers  were shot during the rescue operation — none fatally — and one boy may need to have a  leg amputated.

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[I was concerned about my own safety reporting in the area, so I visit the Jusendo Clinic in Koriyama City. Dr. Masae Kokubun, who greets me with a kind, relaxed smile, appears calm.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Read the book before you see the movie, people are always saying. How about reading a book that takes you so far inside filmmaking that the movie itself doesn't matter anymore? These books are so smart and literary that they are not only for film buffs, but for anyone interested in great storytelling.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[By Lillian Ross, paperback 400 pages, De Capo Press, list price: $16.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Lillian Ross, Grande Dame of The New Yorker, tells the story of director John Huston making The Red Badge of Courage. Ross is the ultimate witty observer, from the first day of shooting to the final release. Ross transforms her access to the "motion picture" industry circa 1951 into a "character study" that leaves nobody unscathed. Here is MGM producer, Gottfried Reinhardt: "I'm on the first floor. Dore Schary is two floors up, right over me.  L.B. is also two floors up. I have a washbasin but no shower in my office. Dore has a shower but no bathtub. L.B. has a shower and a bathtub. The kind of bath facilities you have in your office is another measure of the worth of your position.' He smiled sardonically." Later, he adds, "Our picture must be a commercial success. And it must be a great picture." Does anyone remember the film version of The Red Badge of Courage? Doesn't matter, you will never forget this book.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[By Steven Bach, paperback 432 pages, Newmarket Press, list price: $19.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Everyone loves hearing about somebody else's disaster. When Final Cut came out in 1985, it was the tell-all book about the biggest financial disaster in the film business. This book reads like a murder mystery where the dead body is the studio itself. Heaven's Gate was directed by Michael Cimino, who was given such free rein after sweeping the Oscars with The Deer Hunter that his next film single-handedly brought down an entire studio. In the month after the film was released, United Artists ceased to exist as an independent studio; and Cimino's career has never recovered. Heaven's Gate was the perfect storm that ended the era of the untouchable Hollywood director/auteur.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[ By Michael Ondaatje, paperback 368 pages, Knopf, list price: $21]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[This book is your chance to listen in on probably the most intelligent and far-ranging intellectual conversation on filmmaking.  Walter Murch, the legendary film editor (Apocalypse Now, The Godfather II-III among others) met author Michael Ondaatje on the set of The English Patient and began to share a storyteller's obsession: the how and why behind decisions that ultimately define the story being told.  The great fun with this book is not only the conversation between these two artists — who consider drafts of a poem by Elizabeth Bishop in the same breath as a technical detail about film editing — but you can have a mini-film festival by watching these great films as you read the book.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Songwriter Hugh Martin, who co-wrote the classic song "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" for Judy Garland's 1944 movie, Meet Me in St. Louis, along with dozens of other songs for MGM and Broadway musicals, died on Friday. He was 96.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In 1989, Martin and co-author Ralph Blane, who passed away in 1995, joined Terry Gross for a discussion about their lives and the story of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," which has since been recorded by scores of musicians — including Tori Amos, Garth Brooks, Robert Goulet, Lady Antebellum, James Taylor and Bob Dylan, to name just a few — in the past 65 years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The song "began with the melody," Martin said. "I found a little madrigal-like tune that I liked but couldn't make work, so I played with it for two or three days and then threw it in the wastebasket."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Luckily, Blaine had heard the tune, too — and told Martin it was too good to throw away.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["We dug around the wastebasket and found it," Blaine recalled. "Thank the Lord we found it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[With the melody saved, the two men started working on the words. But the first draft was too sad, and Judy Garland asked for a revision.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["The [film producers] said, 'No, no — it's a sad scene, but we want sort of an upbeat song, which will make it even sadder if she's smiling through her tears," Martin said. "Then we wrote the one you know in the movie."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Martin, who appeared by himself on Fresh Air in 2006, also wrote the music for the Broadway productions Best Foot Forward;  Look Ma, I'm Dancin'; and the stage version of Meet Me in  St. Louis. A memoir, called The Boy Next Door, in which he detailed what it was like to work with Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Gene Kelly, among others, was released last fall.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["The original version was so lugubrious that Judy Garland refused to sing it. She said, 'If I sing that, little Margaret will cry and they'll think I'm a monster.' So I was young then and kind of arrogant, and I said, 'Well, I'm sorry you don't like it, Judy, but that's the way it is, and I don't really want to write a new lyric.' But Tom Drake, who played the boy next door, took me aside and said, 'Hugh, you've got to finish it. It's really a great song potentially, and I think you'll be sorry if you don't do it.' So I went home and I wrote the version that's in the movie."]]></paragraph>

Judy Garland, of course, [was] always tops with me. And Mel Torme, who wrote a beautiful new verse for it, was really out of this world. And Frank Sinatra — you can't beat 'Mr. Blue Eyes.'

That was my favorite Christmas memory."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[We've been chatting with Jack White about been putting out a series of spoken-word 45s on his Third Man Records label — namely, those two focusing on accents and auctioneering. But back in his Detroit days, he re-upholstered furniture, and even hid copies of his records inside.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In this conversation, White talks about his love of craft and his rarest records.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Jack  White: I wanted to be able to talk to people with trade jobs and make  records with them. I want to do more records with carpenters,  electricians, people who specialize in even more bizarre traits that are  off the beaten path.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Bob  Boilen: Tell me if this is a true story, now, because I've carried this  around in my head and it makes me smile — and this may explain your attraction  to craftspeople, as well: You were a craftsperson. You did furniture,  you did upholstery. Your furniture place was — what? Was it Third  Man...?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[White: Third Man Upholstery.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Boilen: Its slogan was?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[White: "Your furniture's not dead."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Boilen: And Third Man Records' slogan is?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[White: "Your turntable's not dead." I don't know what I'll do if I open up a funeral home.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[White: Okay.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"/>
        <paragraph num="15"/>
        <paragraph num="16"/>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Boilen:  "Your sandwich is not dead" might work. Or "Your dry cleaning's not  dead" might work. So I was told you would write either things that you  heard on NPR or poems you would write on scraps of paper while you were  doing upholstery, and stuff it into furniture. Is that a true story?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[White:  Yeah. [Though] most of the stuff I'd write was on the wood frame in the  furniture. 'Cause I thought — something hit me as a teenager while I was  apprenticing in Detroit at an upholstery shop. I said to the guy, Brian  Muldoon, was teaching me — I said, "How come we don't write notes  to each other? Upholsters. We're the only ones who see the insides of  this furniture. We should have so many inside jokes and things we could  write." You know, "This guy was a jerk. He wouldn't pay for this." We  should be telling each other what was the story on these couches. I  started to write a little bit about, well, this is where I got this chair  and the person who hired me to do it — a little bit of that. [And]  maybe on the other side, underneath, I'd hide a poem or something like  that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[And  then we started to — the zenith of that [was when] Brian and I had a  band called The Upholsterers [and] for the 25th anniversary of his shop,  we made a hundred pieces of vinyl. We made a record we stuff into  furniture that you could only get if you ripped the furniture open. We  even made it on clear vinyl with transparency covers — we thought you  couldn't even X-ray it to see if it was in there. I'm talking about —  really, you could rip open a couch and think it's not there 'cause it's  inside the foam — sliced inside the foam and slid in there. I mean, we  really went to great lengths to make sure possibly no one would ever  hear our record! But it's there. It's so great. It's there. There's a  hundred pieces of furniture out there that have those records, and maybe  one day someone will find them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Boilen: No one's found one yet?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[White: No one's found one yet, no.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Boilen: How would they even know to begin to look?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[White:  They could say if they knew the name of the upholstery shop — his  was Muldoon Studio. I don't know if — but they could rip open something  that's totally... there's no record in there. They would be very  unhappy. My guess is, what's gonna happen is it's going to be passed  down a generation and some upholster will reupholster it 40 years from  now and pull the record out and throw it away. That's probably what's  gonna happen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Boilen: That's so sad.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Boilen:  Do you ever miss working with your hands that way? Do you ever want to  go back and do craft? Is there something day-to-day in your life...?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[White:  I just rebuilt my upholstery shop last year. I saved all my tools in  storage — my cutting table, my sewing machine — so I rebuilt my shop,  finally. So I'm doing it again.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Boilen: Wow. Now, would you do this for hire? For yourself? Would you take just your own furniture?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[White:  I'd like to do a couple things — I'd like to just do it for myself and  for people I know. It's be hard to sort of put an ad out there. I don't  have the time to do it for a living anymore, but maybe [I could] just do  it for people I know.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[I'd  be nice to do a project. We did a record with Elvira, Mistress of the  Dark, and I asked her about the settee she always sits on — that famous  couch. I said, "Man, I'd really, really love to upholster that thing  for you." And she said, "Ah, come on, Jack. If you'd've met me a month  ago. I just had that thing reupholstered for the first time ever." I got  so mad. I almost wanted to tell her, "Can I just redo it? Can I rip it  off and redo it?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Boilen: Did they do a nice job?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[White:  Um, yeah, they did a good job. It was okay, yeah. I offered to upholster  Conan O'Brien's chair for his new TV show,  but they didn't want to use  an upholstered chair. I think they wanted something different. But,  yeah, it would be nice to do some projects like that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Boilen: Robin Hilton, any thoughts?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[Robin  Hilton: Hey, Jack. You know, something I thought was really interesting  that you included in the recordings with Amy Walker and Jerry King... we're  listening to you talk to them, and it sounds very much like an interview. And I think I'm hearing news, just a factual news interview. But you  end the interviews by asking if everything that they told you is true.  And it suddenly made me go back and question everything that I just  heard, and it sort of turned it into art more than an interview. Was  that your intent? Or, what were you thinking when you asked them that?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[White:  That was just a question that I threw out at the first Green Series  record did with this guy, BP Fallon. I said, "Is everything you said  today true?" It wasn't the last question I asked him. It was in the  middle. And he said — it was like a second pause — like he was  thinking about it, he said yes. And I thought, that's a great way to end  the record. It's just become a tradition now. I ask that to everybody,  because it's amazing how you'd think that the response [would be] that  everyone would quickly say yes, yes, yes, yes. But they don't. I mean,  people question themselves. And Amy Walker, who does all the accents, I  said, "Is everything you said today true?" And she said, [in an  Australian accent] "Oh, it's all true, darling." It's great. And she's not  telling me the truth — she's putting on a fake accent to tell you it's  all true. How beautiful is that, you know? So it's a nice thing to see  with people. Jerry King, Southern gentleman, [I asked] him, "Is  everything you said true today?" He said, "Yessir." But it's a nice  question to be able to ask.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Boilen: So, Jack White. Has everything you said today been true?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[White: Hmm. I think so. I'll say I think so.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Thirty years ago this month, President Ronald Reagan took a bullet. His would-be assassin was John Hinckley Jr., who shot Reagan outside a Hilton in Washington, D.C., where the president had just spoken to an AFL-CIO lunch.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[These events have been revisited often over the decades. But a new book by journalist Del Quentin Wilber seeks to redefine what we know about that day. The book is called Rawhide Down: The Near Assassination of Ronald Reagan. "Rawhide" was President Reagan's Secret Service code name.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[To write Rawhide Down, Wilber relied on extensive interviews (over 125 in all) with the people who were at the president's side on the day of the shooting. One of those people was Jerry Parr, the lead Secret Service agent at the time. Parr and Wilber spoke to NPR's Ari Shapiro about the day the shots were fired, and how Reagan managed to keep his sense of humor throughout the traumatic event.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The audio version of this story contains tape recordings the Secret Service made public in response to a public records request by author Del Quentin Wilber.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Interview highlights are below.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"/>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[On why Jerry Parr almost decided to take Reagan back to the White House instead of to the ER]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Wilber: "See, no one knows [right away] that Reagan has been shot. Jerry doesn't know. As he is checking Reagan he runs his hands up and down Reagan, and he realizes, there's no blood on my hands, the president must be OK. We've got to get back to the most secure place in the world, the White House."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Parr: "What made me change the course, was that there was a profuse amount of blood coming out of his mouth, and I knew [this was bad] from the training I had in a 10-minute medicine course. I thought maybe I broke a rib when I came down on top of him. So I spoke to the president and I said, 'I'm taking you to the hospital,' and he basically agreed with me. He said OK, and he nodded or something. His blood worried me and his demeanor worried me, though I have often said he was perfectly lucid during the whole ride. We didn't say very much after I decided to go to the hospital. I took a chance that day, but the doctor said if we went to the White House first, and then came back, he'd have been close to dying."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[On the famous moment when Reagan walked himself into the ER]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Wilber: "Reagan hitches up his pants, and he walks in. He walks 20 or 30 feet and collapses like a stone, Jerry and another agent grab him, and they carry him off to the trauma bay; his eyes had rolled back into his head. Nurses, doctors and paramedics who were there thought he was going to die. He looked that bad. But they treated him. They jacked him full of fluids, they got his blood pressure up, they stabilized him and kept him from going too far into shock and that's what saved his life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[On a nurse's shock at treating the president]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Wilber: "One technician was treating him, and doesn't even look up. Then she looks up and sees all the Secret Service agents and says, 'Oh my god, it's Ronald Reagan.' She freaks out. She goes over, picks up smelling salts from the wall, and smells them to shock herself back into attention."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[On Reagan's infamous 'Republican' one-liner before surgery]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Parr: "After he regained consciousness I was standing close to his head, and he had an oxygen mask on but I could hear him, and he said, 'Jerry, I hope they're all Republicans.' We all smiled but we were under a lot of stress and I didn't burst out laughing, and then he did it again. And that's when Dr. Giordano said, 'Today, we're all Republicans.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[On the doctors not immediately realizing that Reagan had been shot]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Wilber: "They think he's broken a rib or punctured a lung. The doctor can't get breath sounds on the left chest. So they think, we better roll him over, and then there is a tiny little slit. The reason it was like that is that the sixth shot smacked the right rear quarter panel of the limousine and slipped through a gap that was about an inch and a half thick, and hit Reagan right in the side about 4 or 5 inches below the armpit. It hit him like a saw, and once it got in his body, it ended up an inch from his heart."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Parr, looking back at his Secret Service career]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Parr: "Since he did live and do what he did for those eight years, you can see the results of saving his life. And that's what our job is, saving lives. Let me reflect on that with you: Before that event, even though there had been attacks on John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King [Jr.], a whole bevy of problems for the Secret Service, we still took a defensive posture. With this event we realized that wouldn't work anymore, and we did it in a flash. That's what came out of it. Yes, it could have been done better, and I was the boss, so I always took the blame, but I will also take the blame for the successes."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[On the reporting process, and nurses' stories from the day of the shooting]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Wilber: "I interviewed a lot of people; I lost count after 125. I really benefited from doctors and nurses who went home and took notes of what happened that day — it was a historic day. They wrote diary entries, even spoke into tape recorders.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[One nurse I spoke to at the end of my process had a wonderful Reagan story. He survives, and he is in the recovery room all night writing funny notes to nurses, like 'All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.' They wheel him off to the ICU, and he is sitting there and [they] comb his hair and get him presentable for his first meeting where he has to sign the dairy bill. And his aides come in, and say, 'Well, Mr. President, we just want to let you know that the guy who did it is crazy, but he is from a good family.' And Reagan says, 'I was kind of hoping it would be the KGB.' And there is a pause, and Reagan says, 'Nah, I don't think so, he wouldn't have missed then.'

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The late Hawaiian musician Israel Kamakawiwo'ole (Kah-MAH-kah-VEE-voh-OH-lay), did something rare in music. He redefined a beloved classic.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[His version of "Over the Rainbow" has the poignancy of Judy Garland's and the shimmering vulnerability, but these days it's heard so often on TV and in the movies, a younger generation may only know Israel's version. It's become so popular, it is now the most requested version of the song by far, according to music publishing house EMI. That's quite remarkable for a rendition with one voice, accompanied only by ukulele.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["In Hawaii, we talk about this thing we call mana," says musician Del Beazley, who grew up with Israel and wrote two of his songs. "Mana is like an energy that you get. We believe we get ours from the elements first, the Earth, your sky, your ocean, your God, and all that is inside of us. And when we open our mouth to speak, to sing or to play, that's what we let out. But it's that that makes him [Israel] special, because his mana always came out."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Beazley remembers the first time he heard Israel sing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[They were teenagers and Israel showed up with his older brother Skippy at a graduation party.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["They set up with instruments that were kind of beat up. In fact, one of the ukuleles was held together with bubble gum. What happened was, as soon as Israel Kamakawiwo'ole opened his mouth and sang, that whole place went quiet. Every great singer has something special. It's almost a nasal or head tone. And that thing just cut right through the air, stopped everybody in their tracks."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Israel was still a teenager when he and his brother formed a band with three other local guys. They called themselves the Makaha Sons of Ni'ihau. In the 1970s, young Hawaiians were rediscovering their language and culture. In music, that meant getting away from kitschy hula tunes for tourists, like "My Little Grass Shack." Israel's group was among those who embraced traditional melodies.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Israel was the group's standout — for his voice and also his size. Both he and Skippy weighed hundreds of pounds — the girth of sumo wrestlers. Israel was over 6 feet tall with flowing black hair.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The 1988 Recording Session That Made Him A Legend]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[It began at 3 in the morning. Milan Bertosa was at the end of a long day in his Honolulu recording studio.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["And the phone rings. It was a client of mine," Bertosa remembers. The client rattled off Israel's unpronounceable name and said he wanted to come in and record a demo. Bertosa said he was shutting down, call tomorrow. But the client insisted on putting Israel on the phone. "And he's this really sweet man, well-mannered, kind. 'Please, can I come in? I have an idea,' " Bertosa remembers Israel saying.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Bertosa relented and gave Israel 15 minutes to get there. Soon, there was a knock at the door.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["And in walks the largest human being I had seen in my life. Israel was probably like 500 pounds. And the first thing at hand is to find something for him to sit on." The building security found Israel a big steel chair. "Then I put up some microphones, do a quick sound check, roll tape, and the first thing he does is 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow.' He played and sang, one take, and it was over."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The next day, Bertosa made a copy for Israel and filed the original recording away. But he was so taken with it, that over the next few years, he played it occasionally for family and friends. "It was that special," he says. "Whatever was going on that night, he was inspired. It was like we just caught the moment."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Jump Ahead Five Years]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[In 1993, Milan Bertosa wound up working as an engineer for Mountain Apple Company in Honolulu, a long-established recording house, where Israel was making a solo album. As Bertosa listened during the final days of recording, he had an epiphany. He turned to producer Jon de Mello and said, "This is great, but there's more." Bertosa fished out "Over the Rainbow" and played it for de Mello.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["Israel was really sparkly, really alive," recalls de Mello after hearing the recording. "He had a grand heart attack in 1989, so this was right before his heart attack." De Mello put "Over the Rainbow" (actually a medley, with "What a Wonderful World") on Facing Future, which is still the best-selling Hawaiian album of all time, thanks to one song.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["There's been a bunch of articles written about 'Over the Rainbow,' " says Bertosa. "He gets the lyrics wrong, he changes the melody. If you sat there with a book and a score card, you could count the mistakes or you could listen to the song and smile."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Israel weighed close to 700 pounds when he came to de Mello to start a solo career in 1993. He was in and out of the hospital.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[His brother Skippy died from complications of obesity, as had almost all of Israel's immediate family. He knew he was destined for a brief life. To de Mello, everything Israel sang and said became precious. So he instructed his engineers to keep the tape rolling for all the rehearsals, all the jokes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Israel was a very funny man, he says. "And every session, I would keep him for an hour afterwards." Just tell me stories, he told Israel. "There was such great content in what this beautiful Hawaiian man was talking about — the trials and tribulations of his own life and his family's life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["I was scared when I lost my mother, my father, my brother, my sister," Israel told de Mello. "I guess this is gonna sound kind of weird, but I'm not scared for myself for dying. Because I believe all these places are temporary. This is just one shell. Because we Hawaiians live in both worlds. It's in our veins. When our time come, don't cry for me. Don't cry for me. Plant a tree in the middle ... where they play soccer," he laughs. "Kind of small, then I'll grow big."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[In the summer of 1997, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole , by then one of the most beloved singers in the history of Hawaiian music, died of respiratory failure.  He was 38 — and just beginning to see the huge success of "Over the Rainbow."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Days later, he was cremated, along with his vintage Martin ukulele — the one he used to record "Over the Rainbow." The ashes were carried on a traditional Hawaiian voyaging canoe.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["In the old days," says Beazley, "people would wail when the mo'i or 'king' passed away — and cry. And that's really what it was.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[According to Republican strategist Frank Luntz, Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 "because he, more than any other political figure, understood what was happening in the country at that time, and had an innate ability to communicate it right back." Luntz analyzes this victory and others in his new book Win: The Key Principles to Take Your Business from Ordinary to Extraordinary.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[As a longtime media strategist, Luntz has helped craft many sound bites and political phrases during his career, from "death tax" to the "Contract with America." In Win, Luntz argues that careful messaging is as essential to business as it is to politics.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["The best advertising and the best communication when it comes to business is that which makes you smile, that which makes you think, that which makes you ponder," Luntz tells NPR's Neal Conan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[People "want to be inspired. They want to aspire to something. ... You can have the best product, the best service, the best argument in a debate," says Luntz. "But without the effective words you still lose. In the end you need good principles and good language if you are to succeed."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Politicians are under particular pressure to communicate effectively, says Luntz. "They are living, breathing embodiments of the language they use ... when you're selling a product or service it doesn't have to be absolutely perfect," he says. "When you're a politician, one wrong word changes the ... meaning of something."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[As a pollster, Luntz has conducted extensive surveys and focus groups for political clients. One of the most powerful political advertisements he's tested, he says, is Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott's slogan, "Let's get to work."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["He used 'lets get to work' to say, all these politicians talk — it's time to do," says Luntz. "Everybody else talks about the problem — it's time to find a solution."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Visuals are also critical to effective messaging, says Luntz — something that Scott used to his advantage in a campaign advertisement invoking the "Let's get to work" slogan. The ad depicts Scott "moving down an alleyway, putting his jacket on and looking like this guy's gonna kick some butt. ... 'Let's get to work' says, 'Lets get it done.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Equally powerful in both political and commercial messaging, says Luntz, are images that listeners or viewers must supply themselves. "The perfect opening is 'imagine,' " says Luntz, "because imagine allows you to communicate in the eyes or vision of the listener rather than yours."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Luntz looks to the classic George Orwell novel 1984 to illustrate the point. "Room 101 --" says Lunz, referring to the torture chamber depicted in the book, "we all have our own imagination about what that looks like. When we saw the movie, and we saw what they said Room 101 was, it didn't work for anybody. Because it's not how we imagine it," says Lunz.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["To imagine 'the American dream' allows the listener to define the communication on their own terms. That's what makes it so powerful."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Speech therapist Sam Chwat, a dialect specialist who worked closely with people in business, politics and the film industry who wanted to lose a regional accent — or pick one up — died last Thursday. He was 57. His family told The New York Times that the cause was lymphoma.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Chwat worked with many film stars, including Isabella Rossellini, Danny Glover, Marcia Gay Harden, Willem Dafoe and Olympia Dukakis.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Julia Roberts sought him out, first to lose her Georgia accent and then to regain it for her role in Steel Magnolias. He helped another southerner, Andie MacDowell, after her lines for Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan were dubbed by Glenn Close.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Chwat also worked with many business executives who wanted to change their regional speech patterns because they thought it would help their careers. In 1994 on Fresh Air, he told Terry Gross that most clients came to him because they felt that their dialect distracted people from what they were saying.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["People are listening to how they say their words instead of what they're saying," he said. "This could be deadly if you're doing a commercial. It could be deadly if you're giving a business presentation."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Other reasons people come is because they find that they're stigmatized as being members of a discriminated subgroup. [They say,] 'I sound too black,' 'I sound too 'New York.' ... Or they feel that parts of their speech make them unintelligible or difficult to understand because most people are expecting standard American speech, which is an easier pattern for most people to understand."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Acquiring A New Voice]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Some of Chwat's clients needed to learn an entirely new regional accent for their movie roles. Actor Robert De Niro needed to lose his New Yorker sound and pick up an Appalachian accent for the movie Cape Fear. Chwat worked with De Niro one-on-one in an intense immersion course that lasted several hours a day, five days a week, for almost three months before shooting began.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["We worked very hard and long on that one, and [De Niro] did beautifully," Chwat said. "What you're hearing [in Cape Fear] is mostly vowels that are changed. For example, instead of family, you're hearing a more nasal sound in the 'a.' Instead of the vowel 'i,' which never exists in any part of the South, you have [the sound] 'ah.' These are some of the changes that we went through, word for word, in the script and all through the shooting."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Chwat also worked with regional news anchors to develop what he called "unremarkable ways of speech."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["You want to listen to what they're saying and not how they're saying it," he said. "The most important thing about those people or people who aspire to those jobs is that they don't reveal where they're from; their accents are identifiably American, and you listen to their content and not to their style."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[For all his work with high-profile individuals, it was mainly ordinary people — New Yorkers and recent immigrants who wanted to sound more assimilated — whom Chwat helped at the Sam Chwat Speech Center in Lower Manhattan. He employed six speech therapists and drilled clients on their phrasing and conversational speech, making sure they knew how to self-correct themselves midsentence. He also advised all of his clients to smile naturally while talking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["[If] you use your face while you are speaking, [you] reduce the monotone effect that some people have where their voice is very, very flat," he said. "If we help [clients] throw in a smile or some facial flexibility, their voices will sound more colorful and more interesting and more pleasing to listen to."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"/>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["People are adaptable to different degrees. One fact that I'm sure of is that the bulk of your accent does develop between 3 years and 7 years [of age], and is based on where you grow up and among which peers you grow up, as opposed to your parents and what accents they speak. You can think about people in your family or people in your past who were brought up in Europe and have identifiably European ways of speech. If their children were brought up here and were between the ages of 3 and 7, their accents reflect the community they grow up in rather than their parents' accents. People are adaptable after that age, and there is some plasticity and changeability in people depending on how adaptable they are and how long they're in a particular place — and how much they're resisting or trying to blend into the area."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[San Diego, known for its nice weather, attracts even the homeless. About 4,600 people live on city streets or in shelters, and the number has been growing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Now, the city has joined more than 70 other cities — such as Phoenix, Tucson and Nashville — in a national campaign to get 100,000 chronically homeless people into permanent housing. It was started by the New York City group Common Ground. Those leading the effort think it could be the first step toward drastically reducing homelessness in the U.S.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[There are some who doubt that counting and interviewing San Diego's homeless will get them off the streets, and that this campaign will succeed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Why are we counting homeless people? We've counted them for the last 25 years that I've been doing this," says Bob McElroy, who heads the Alpha Project, which runs the city's temporary winter shelter for the homeless. Every year, there's a huge debate over whether and where it should open.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA['We're Not Operating In Silos Anymore']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[But those leading the new campaign say many things are different this time.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The first difference is who's involved. Just about everyone in San Diego who has anything to do with homelessness is at the table — the police, the housing commission, area hospitals, lawmakers, nonprofits, businesses, even the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["We're not operating in silos anymore," says Robin Munro, who is helping to lead the effort. She's with the Downtown San Diego Partnership, which works to improve the city's central business district. Munro drives around Horton Plaza Park, in the heart of San Diego, to show why even the business community is now on board with housing the homeless.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["You can see, there's people who live in there, on the other side too," she says, as she points to a makeshift camp made out of five black umbrellas, with several shopping carts nearby.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Munro says this park is supposed to be the gateway to the commercial district. But instead it's become a barrier, scaring off customers and retailers alike. She says housing the homeless is a humanitarian issue, but adds, "It's also an economic issue. Your business is not going to do as well if people have to crawl over somebody sleeping in your doorstep."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[And people are sleeping all over downtown, on corners, sidewalks, under bridges. Almost 100 people spend the night beneath the interstate highway, and many of them clearly need help. A longtime homeless veteran named Brian Whitworth says it's scary living there, as he walks away from a woman who screams that there are snakes crawling all over her body — although there are none.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["You never know what's going to happen one second to the next," Whitworth says. "Imagine how can you try and sleep at night when you got people walking around. They're going to try and threaten your life at every second of your life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[A Vicious Cycle]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The situation is dire. But those running the new campaign say it'll cost more if they do nothing. They estimate that it costs about $25,000 a year to house a chronically homeless person, even with services like medical care. But it can be four or five times that amount if someone stays on the streets, repeatedly using things like the hospital emergency room.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Philip Doud is a good example. He's among the first to be housed under the campaign. Volunteers went out last fall to interview the city's homeless and create profiles so they could house the most vulnerable people first. They found the 53-year-old veteran and his girlfriend sleeping on a sidewalk, and offered him a $5 fast-food coupon if he'd answer some questions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I didn't really think ... it would come to anything," says Doud, who sits in his new one-bedroom apartment.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Doud is a former drug addict who's been homeless on and off for 20 years.  He's also been in and out of jail — usually for what he calls "stupid" offenses, such as stealing a flashlight.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["You've got to have a flashlight when you're homeless," Doud says. "To see stuff, see the medicine bottles, whatever."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Doud says it's hard to take medication when you're on the streets. But it's a vicious cycle. He suffers from anxiety, depression and high blood pressure. If he doesn't take his medicine, he gets stressed, even violent, ending up in the emergency room or back in jail.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[In an apartment, Doud can keep the 30 pills he takes each day neatly organized. He says now he's a law-abiding citizen, who's trying to get his life back on track.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["We view this really as a health care issue in [the] VA," says Clay King, chief of social work at the VA in San Diego. His agency is providing 75 housing vouchers to the campaign and services, such as health care and counseling, for those who are housed. The idea is to make sure that people like Doud stay housed and, it's hoped, go on to lead productive lives.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[King says this campaign is so promising because many groups are pitching in.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Hundreds of people sleep on San Diego's streets each night, on corners, beneath the interstate and across from the public library.  They hang out in small groups or sit alone, watching the time pass. But when a wiry man with dark glasses approaches, everyone seems to perk up.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The man is David Ross, better known as Waterman Dave. For years, he's handed out hundreds of bottles of water each day to the homeless. He's a 75-year-old retiree who's made it his mission to help the homeless — even if it's just with a hug or a kind word.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Many who live on these streets turn to him for help — and hope. The city has joined about 70 others in a new national campaign to get 100,000 long-term homeless people into permanent housing over the next three years. But many of San   Diego's homeless say they'll believe it when they see it. They've been disappointed before.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Men and women shout out greetings when Waterman Dave approaches in his old, beat-up black car.  He calls it his "Homeless Hyundai," though he's not homeless himself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Hey, David. It's Waterman Dave," they shout.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Gray hair sticks out from under his Detroit Lions cap. The word "peace" is embroidered on the arm of his sweatshirt. It looks like he hasn't shaved for days.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Hey brother, I got some juice and stuff for you," Ross tells one homeless man outside the city library, as another kids and asks: "Do you have my cheeseburger and curly fries?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA['I Care About You']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[On these streets, things change in an instant. It can be burgers and fries one minute, life and death the next.  As Ross chats, one homeless man, Mark Chapman, quickly pulls him aside. Chapman says he's worried about his friend Randy and points to a young bearded man, who sits curled up on the curb, his head hanging down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["He already took out a knife," Chapman says, making a quick slicing motion along his wrist.  "And I was able to stop him from it.  I put some paper towels..." he pauses. Then he adds, "I said, 'Please give me that knife.' I can't get it from him. I'm really worried about him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[As Chapman talks, his friend can be seen fumbling with a pocketknife on his lap. Chapman tells Ross they were both released from the county mental health center that afternoon and decided to go drinking — a bad move. Waterman Dave sits down next to Randy to see if he can help and finds out he has a sister.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["If we could call her, and let her know, would that be OK with you if I did that?" Ross asks Randy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[The man nods. Then he looks up.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["Why are you worried about me?" he asks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["Because I love you, man," Ross responds.  "I care about you.  Hey, let me ask you something, Randy.  If I was laying out here in your situation, would you help me?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["Yes," Randy replies.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["God bless you, man," Ross says. "And that's why I'm helping you, because we're brothers."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[A Call To The Police]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[But it's not easy to help in a city where, as in many others across the country, social agencies are swamped. There are almost 4,600 homeless people in San Diego. Many are substance abusers or mentally ill. There are programs to help them, but not nearly enough. Sometimes an old, somewhat eccentric do-gooder is the only help around.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Ross calls Randy's sister to tell her what's going on. She says Randy suffers from mental illness and has tried to kill himself before. But she lives on the East Coast, so Ross calls the police, his only real choice this time of night.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The police say they're going to take Randy to a homeless shelter, but it's full. They take him to the emergency room instead. But he can't be held there against his will and he soon returns to the streets. It will be weeks before a police-outreach team runs into him again and gets him into a treatment program.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Ross is discouraged. He says the city keeps promising it's going to fix things, but when he goes to a nearby underpass, he can see almost 100 people camped out for the night.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["This is after a 10-year plan to eradicate homelessness forever," he says.  "I wish somebody could tell me at about what level we are now in that 10-year plan."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[No Answers]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Those leading the new campaign to house the city's homeless say things are different now. Robin Munro, a local businesswoman who has helped organize the effort, says homelessness has gotten so bad that people in the city — the government, businesses, nonprofit groups — have finally come together to get something done.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["I don't think historically we've done a good job, and we weren't working together," she says.  "For the first time, we have made it one of our top priorities to solve this problem."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[In the meantime, at a winter shelter for homeless veterans, Ross is greeted like an ice-cream man on a hot summer day. Dozens of men line up less for the water than for a chance to joke around.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Bruce Bulmon, a former Marine who's been homeless on and off for 20 years, says it means a lot to these men that someone is looking out for them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["They die on the streets out here," he says.  "If it wasn't for Dave, there would be nobody out there except for maybe some church groups, and it would be hit and miss."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[But some people here think, in a way, Ross is part of the problem, that people like him make life easier for the homeless so they're less inclined to seek help in programs that have lots of rules, like no alcohol. With his own money and donations, Ross has provided portable toilets in neighborhoods where the homeless hang out. He successfully sued the city to get a place where the homeless can store their belongings, so they can go to job interviews or doctor's appointments without bringing a shopping cart.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Ross says, if he's an enabler, so be it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["I've been called a whole lot worse than that," he says. "I was a car dealer, give me a break!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Ross says he helps the homeless now that he's retired because he had an unhappy childhood spending time in a boys' home. He says he understands what it's like to be unloved and discarded.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[Under a highway bridge where more homeless people are camping out, Ross sighs before getting out of his car. He admits he doesn't have the answers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA["It just makes me so sad," he says. "Because when I get out of this car right now, the only thing I can bring to them is a smile, a hug, a little encouragement and a laugh — and a bottle of water."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[More than 30 years ago, a nonprofit was launched in New York City to try to find permanent housing for chronically homeless people in Times Square. Now it has a national campaign that some people think could be an important first step toward ending homelessness in America.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Standing outside an elegant 15-story brick building in midtown Manhattan, Rosanne Haggerty, who runs the nonprofit Common Ground, recalls how it all began — how a former hotel became a model for housing the homeless.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["In the early '80s, I lived right next-door to the Times Square Hotel," she says. "It was back in the day when Times Square was Times Square, as we say — kind of a crazy neighborhood to say the least."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The area was known mostly for peep shows and prostitutes. It was long before anyone dreamed that Times Square would become a family destination.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Haggerty worked with the homeless at the time, and was upset to find out that the hotel was about to shut down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["It was the largest single-room occupancy hotel in New York City," she says. "The building was practically on the verge of being condemned.  It had 1,700 serious building code violations."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Trash, mildew and crack vials were everywhere. But Haggerty, then 29, saw the potential. She says she thought it made a lot of sense to fix the building up so all of the homeless people outside would have somewhere to live. And she thought it would be good to provide services, like health care and job training, so people would be more likely to stay off the streets.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Reaching Those On The Outside]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[It turned out that her timing was great. It was 1990, and city leaders were eager to clean up the Times Square area and to deal with New York's growing homeless problem. The federal government also had money to help. So Haggerty founded Common Ground and got to work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Today, it's difficult to tell the Times Square Building apart from a pricey Manhattan condo, with its marble lobby, gold-trimmed ceilings and art deco light fixtures. Haggerty points to two elegant curved staircases at one end of the lobby.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I think Grace Kelly may sweep down at any moment," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[But it's not Grace Kelly here today. Instead, more than 650 formerly homeless and low-income tenants live in the building, complete with services such as job counseling.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[So, mission accomplished? Not exactly. After their Times Square Building was up and running for a few years, Haggerty and her staff started to notice something: There were still a lot of homeless people outside.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["You kind of expected, or at least I did, naively, this shift to happen. That building opens — homelessness, you don't see it anymore. The neighborhood just fixed it," Haggerty says. "And so it was this great puzzle. Like, what didn't we do?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[What they didn't do, it turns out, was talk to people living on the streets to find out what they wanted. Almost everyone living in the building had come here by way of the city's homeless shelters. As for those still outside?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["We had no clue," Haggerty says. "None of us in the field had any clue. We had just written people off because we thought their failure to use the shelter system meant they didn't want help, they didn't want the shelter."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Haggerty realized she needed to know two key things: who was living on the streets and what it would take to get them inside.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[The Vulnerability Index]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[And that's the next step in social innovation — fixing what doesn't work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["Somehow it occurred to me: Maybe I need someone with a military background," Haggerty recalls. So she hired Becky Kanis, a West Point graduate and former special ops commander with the Army.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["I didn't know anything about homelessness," Kanis says. But she did know how to get things done.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Kanis took a team of outreach workers into the streets and started interviewing homeless people and creating detailed profiles. They then ranked each individual on a scale from 0 to 8, using something called a vulnerability index — simply put, the higher the number, the more likely the person would die on the streets if he or she didn't get help.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["We start off our relationship with people really just getting to the bottom line," Kanis says. "How long have you been here? How sick are you? Do you want housing? Most people do. Let's work it out together. And the outreach teams in New York house in that order. They house in order of length of homelessness and vulnerability."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[She says it's a big shift from the old way of doing things, which was to help the homeless first come, first served. The idea is to focus resources on those who need the most help, even if they don't come seeking it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Samuel Novacich, a housing advocate with Common Ground, shows how the system works. He and a colleague drive a van around lower Manhattan looking for a homeless client who is moving up the vulnerability list.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["The one we're going to look for now has been out for a number of years, and he also suffers from schizophrenia and alcohol dependence," Novacich says. They're stepping up efforts to get him inside.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[The case workers pull up to a sidewalk on Avenue D, where they see a pile of blankets. They suspect the man is sleeping there. When Novacich gets out and gently pokes the mound, a man with long, stringy hair and fingernails caked with dirt emerges. He takes a sip from a half-pint of vodka as Novacich tries to cajole him into getting help.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA["Let's make a plan," Novacich tells the man, who gives his name as Ravi. "Let's make a plan for early next week. Monday? We'll come by, put you in the hospital, do like a nice stay, and you'll come out good as new. Think about it over the weekend maybe."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Ravi is reluctant. He says he doesn't like hospitals, especially the food.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[A National Campaign]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[It can take months, even years to get someone inside. But Common Ground says it's worth it — it costs less to house and treat a man like Ravi than to leave him on the street, where he'll use emergency services again and again.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[They say taking care of the most serious cases also has a ripple effect. Many of the less serious cases will take care of themselves. And there have been some encouraging results. When Becky Kanis started at Common Ground, there were 55 chronically homeless people living in the Times Square area. Now there are none, according to Haggerty.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Haggerty started getting a lot of attention for her work — even a MacArthur Foundation genius grant. More recently, she says, other cities across the country started calling. They were interested in trying the same thing in their communities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[So Common Ground launched its national campaign to house 100,000 chronically homeless people over the next three years. More than 70 cities have already signed up — places like Phoenix, Nashville, Tucson, Seattle and San   Diego.  They've each conducted their own homeless surveys and collectively have found permanent housing for more than 7,500 people.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[Kanis says the cities are also sharing tips, such as how to cut through government red tape, to improve what Common Ground began.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["They call us and say, 'We just changed this rule,' and we're like, 'Oh, that's fantastic,' and we tell everybody else. And that's just how the campaign grew, very organically," Kanis says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Not everyone is sold on the idea, and there are some people who doubt it will make a big dent in the homeless population.  Patrick Markee of the Coalition for the Homeless, another group in New York City, says Common Ground has done a lot of good for the long-term homeless.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA["But we shouldn't lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that the large majority of homeless people are not this chronically homeless population," he says. "We're talking about families. We're talking about children. We're talking about folks that have been impacted by the economic crisis."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[Markee says if you want to end homelessness, you have to address their problems, too — such as the lack of affordable housing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[Haggerty and Kanis insist that they're on the right track, but they know the proof will be in the results of their three-year campaign.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Carnival season on the Caribbean island of Trinidad boils down to one thing: fresh soca music. Consider it Red Bull for your ears, or music with a purpose.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["The intention of the energy of soca music is to really uplift people; really make them smile; keep them happy; make them celebrate even in the toughest times," says Machel Montano, soca's biggest star. "The economy is down — you hear some soca music, you're gonna want to go out and party, even if you have to borrow the money."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Soca stands for "soul of calypso," and it was pretty much invented in the 1970s by Trinidadian artist Lord Shorty, who claimed that the soul of calypso was as multicultural as his island's African and East Indian descendants. To set this post-colonial hybrid to music, Shorty sped up calypso and gave it an Indian twist.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"/>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[In the 30 or so years since its invention, soca has evolved into the club-friendly, studio-produced music of a younger generation. Soca artist Kees Dieffenthaler explains it this way: "It's kind of like calypso's young, teenaged bad son," he says, "it's really a younger sound, more vibrant than calypso."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Soca artists record, release and perform music at a frenzied pace during carnival season, when the whole country is partying to the same soundtrack. Every year, performers campaign in a kind of musical election — competing for two titles. "The Road March song" is a people's choice award—it's the most-played song during the grand parade held the day before Ash Wednesday. "The Soca Monarch," on the other hand, is crowned at a massive concert held just before carnival. One contender for this year's crown is Fay-Ann Lyons.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Soca Monarch is something like American Idol but on a different scale. It's grand; it's extravagant; it's flamboyant; it's bold — it's like everybody does a piece of Las Vegas, with all the costumes. Imagine seeing that from 10 different competitors, all expressing and presenting their songs to the judges, trying to win first prize."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Lyons calls her own sound "aggressive and tomboyish." She has a strong track record, having won more titles than any other female soca star. In 2009, she won both Soca Monarch and Road March—while 8 months pregnant.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Lyons is soca royalty: her father is calypsonian Superblue and her husband is soca star Bunji Garlin — call them soca's Beyonce and Jay-Z. Garlin says he tries to set his music apart by looking back to soca's roots in calypso. "One of the other names of an ancient calypsonian was a poor man newspaper," he says. "They would be the person to bring the news of what happens today or what happens tomorrow. The calypsonian is the person who have the information and will bring it to the people."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[He's recorded songs about rape and politics, and once won Soca Monarch with the rare soca song that isn't about dancing or drinking — "In the Ghetto," a song about poverty and government failure.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Every year, though, the favored candidate is Machel Montano, a soca icon, known for being obscenely good at what Trinidadians call wining: gyrating to the music.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["Basically I think my talent is really reaching out to people and talking to them," says Montano, "getting them in a good mood; make them laugh; make them wine; and still make them jump."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Montano is 36 years old, and has released 35 albums. He's been a star since he was nine, when he won a local competition with the song "Too Young to Soca."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The song quickly landed him on the stage of Madison  Square Garden and on Star Search. He's since collaborated with Janet Jackson and Doug E. Fresh, but he says he still hasn't achieved his ultimate goal: to carry the energy of soca beyond his island.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["I love a lot of pop dance, electro music because I can even see the spirit in the beat," he says. "I can see people in the club singing about love, singing about limits, singing about world peace, singing about coming together, singing about lettin' go troubles. And somewhere in there I see where soca music could find a space, could find its place."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Right now, its place is Trinidad, where a local election is underway. The candidates are stumping; the voters are jumping; and the new campaign slogans — hot new soca tunes — just keep on coming.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[On broadcast television, the February ratings sweeps ended Wednesday. Sweeps periods are when the networks compete aggressively to attract the largest audiences because those are the numbers used to set advertising rates for the next three months.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Now that the February sweeps are over, almost all of the network shows are reruns — and it's also why we're about to face a new onslaught of reality TV shows. Reality shows are a low-cost, low-risk way of rolling the dice and hoping for a sudden hit. And if it doesn't catch on? No big deal: You finish out the cycle and replace it with something else, or replace it immediately if the ratings are that low. But if it hits big, it's a major moneymaker.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But a decade into the current cycle of broadcast TV reality shows, much of the novelty has worn off.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Even the durable programs have to rely on tricks to keep audiences coming back. Donald Trump's The Apprentice series, on NBC, has upped the ante with celebrity editions for a while now — even though its definition of "celebrity" is way too generous.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[This Sunday, the newest cycle of Celebrity Apprentice premieres, and the loosest cannon in its arsenal is Gary Busey, whose level of quirkiness has fueled other reality shows in the past. So here he is, misbehaving again, with predictable unpredictability.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[And that's the problem with reality TV this year: Even when the programs aren't familiar reruns, the contestants are. On CBS, we have former Survivor contestants Russell and Boston Rob fighting it out on new teams. On the same network's The Amazing Race, we have 16 losing teams from former editions, lining up to try, try again.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Another problem is that even a new show can seem old, because its parts are so familiar. This weekend ABC launches Secret Millionaire, which is an unwatchable rip-off of the nearly as manipulative Undercover Boss on CBS. Is there any broadcast TV reality show with a spark of originality these days?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Yes, there is — and, like Secret Millionaire and Celebrity Apprentice and The Amazing Race, it shows up this Sunday. It's NBC's America's Next Great Restaurant, and it comes from the producers of Bravo's Top Chef.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[There are two variations that make this new show stand out. One is that instead of having cooks compete for prizes, or a dream job in a top restaurant — as they do on Top Chef and Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen — this time they compete for investors and the chance to launch a dream business.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[That's a familiar idea, too, from such shows as ABC's Shark Tank — but in America's Next Great Restaurant, all the contestants are competing in the same category for the backing to open a chain of three restaurants. They're trying to impress the likes of chefs Bobby Flay and Curtis Stone, and this time, the panel isn't just judging, it's mentoring. In Sunday's premiere, the narrator points out that the "stakes couldn't be any higher."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The stakes, in that context, don't refer to juicy grilled pieces of meat — but those come later, along with casual restaurants built around grilled cheese sandwiches, Indian fusion and meatballs. In the first episode, the judges hear the pitches, taste the food and select the finalists. In Week 2, the contestants are taken to an open-air mall to set up booths and serve one sample item to a crowd of 1,000 people, each of whom has a vote. And judges Flay and Steve Ells, the founder of Chipotle, offer opinions, too — passing judgment on everything from the food to the logo to even the would-be restaurant's name.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[It's the mentoring that makes America's Next Great Restaurant distinctive, and intriguing. The experts here aren't just passing judgment. Every step of the way, they're offering cold, valuable advice — and each step of the way, as one contestant gets eliminated, the visions of the others get more focused, and more impressive.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[I suspect that with this show, as with American Idol, a finalist need not win to succeed. After a few weeks of exposure on a show like this, they might find other investors eager to help them make their dreams come true. But for that to happen, America's Next Great Restaurant has to last a few weeks. And most new TV shows, like most new restaurants, fail quickly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[But America's Next Great Restaurant — with a tone that is more positive than negative — is one show I expect will beat the odds. The judges are sincere and likable, the show taps into a common dream and it makes me smile — and at times, it even makes me hungry.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The toppling of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has released a pent-up flood of Egyptian political diversity.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[New parties are being formed left and right — some of them brand new and others long denied legitimacy by the former regime.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[It used to be that politics was a topic that required little discussion, other than the darkly humorous jokes Egyptians love to tell about the political class. But since the upheaval known as the "January 25th Revolution," you can hardly get a word in edgewise.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Tahrir Square is alive with retail-level politics. All manner of issues,  grievances and ideas are under discussion at any hour of the day or  night. Salah Abdel-Saleem, a tall man with an engaging smile and no  political experience to speak of, is practicing his stump speech.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["The largest and strongest party on the scene right now is the January 25th Party," says Abdel-Saleem, practicing. "We are the only party that represents the young people of Egypt who made all this freedom possible. And I am their presidential candidate."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[There are a few catches though. Besides having neither a budget nor campaign-savvy staff, the January 25th Party has yet to be approved to participate in the elections, which could be coming in less than six months.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[This is a problem facing any number of parties; there's a labor-based party, the Democratic Freedom Party, an offshoot of the old left-wing Tagammu Party, and others. Many have little experience, while two groups — the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and the remnants of Mubarak's National Democratic Party — have a lot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Publisher and democracy advocate Hisham Kassem says that while he commends the Egyptian military for wanting to relinquish political power sooner rather than later, he worries six months is too soon for these new parties to get on their feet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["The important thing for me in the next election is that no single current dominates — and specifically the Muslim Brotherhood," Kassem says. "My estimate is they'll get between 10 to 20 percent maximum, but their rightful share is 10 percent. They're simply an organized minority who still operated under Mubarak because they operated from the mosque, as opposed to us who had no place to operate from — and Mubarak couldn't close down the mosques."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[The very first new party approved in the wake of Mubarak's demise is setting out to prove Kassem's hunch that the brotherhood's popularity will fade now that voters have other options.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Al-Wasat, or the Center Party, was formed in a part by brotherhood members who rebelled against the old guard's insistence on mixing religion and politics and on discriminating against women.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[They were denied a party license for 15 years by Mubarak's government. Analysts say the regime was anxious to keep the focus on the brotherhood, which it employed as an extremist threat to worry the West.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[But now Wasat can compete. Chairman Abou Elela Mady says the difference between Wasat and the Muslim Brotherhood is simple: The brotherhood emphasizes Islam in every facet of life, while Wasat wants to keep religion separate from politics.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["So Wasat [is] very different from Muslim Brotherhood," Mady says. "First of all, you know Muslim Brotherhood is still a religious group. They have a job, [a] preaching job, and also they have a political wing. I think this is very dangerous in a society like Egyptian or Arab world. So we separated between the two jobs. We only specialize in the political activities, politics."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Mady also says his party gives full equality to women and has no problem upholding Egypt's international agreements, including the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty with Israel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Wasat's supporters believe the party could appeal to a broad cross section of voters, but not if they have less than six months to prepare and run a nationwide campaign. That's why Mady and others are asking the military supreme council to delay the elections by at least another six months.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[In these heady days, anything seems possible. Optimists envision an Egyptian electorate, eager to embrace a democratic, secular government that will see its first task as drafting a new constitution to enshrine equal opportunity and freedom of expression.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[But others wonder if the wealthy families that used to steer huge numbers of rural votes to Mubarak's regime will continue to support a reinvented version of the former ruling party. Likewise, the superior organizational skills of the Muslim Brotherhood could vault them ahead of many of these new parties with the paint sill drying on their office walls.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[For the moment, however, Egyptians are reveling in a cacophony of political expression, uncorked at last and spraying joyously in all directions at once.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The federal government and the states have shared the cost of Medicaid, the health insurance program for some 60 million low-income Americans, since it was created in 1965.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[They've shared something else almost that long — arguments about who should foot how much of the ever-escalating bill.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["Medicaid cost growth has been a problem for time immemorial," says Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But this time, he says, things are different.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[For one thing, "the program is bigger, so growth on a larger base is more real dollars that's harder to find."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Ending Support Early?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Indeed, at this weekend's meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington,  Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker [attending via teleconference due to his own state's budget crisis] pointed out that of his state's projected $3.6 billion budget deficit over the next two years, fully half "is attributable to Medicaid."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[In fact, enrollment in Medicaid in recent years has outstripped its better-known sibling, Medicare. Medicaid's low-income beneficiaries are mostly pregnant women, children, seniors, and those with disabilities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[A second problem, says Weil, is that this particular economic downturn is lasting much longer than many economists predicted. That means not only less revenue coming in for states, but more people qualifying for Medicaid, because they have lost their jobs and their health insurance.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Congress had been giving the states extra money for Medicaid. But it's about to end — as of July 1. Weil says if the federal government had continued that financial aid to the states, "we probably wouldn't be hearing what we're hearing now. But basically the federal support is ending a little bit too early relative to when state revenues are picking up."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA['Tied Our Hands']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[That was a common theme sounded by governors at a meeting of their Health and Human Services Committee Sunday.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["I had to come up with $540 million to plug the Medicaid hole," said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, "because of the onetime stimulus money and other onetime state money that was used."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Dennis Smith, former federal Medicaid chief who is now Wisconsin's secretary of health services said: "It's going to be about $600 million over a two-year period of time. So we have to make up that money for ourselves, without really helping anyone or making any changes."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But what really makes this Medicaid fight different from ones that have come before is the impact of the health overhaul passed last year, which calls for a huge expansion of Medicaid in 2014 to low-income childless adults.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[States won't actually be on the hook for most of those costs; all but 10 percent will be paid by the federal government.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[But between now and 2014, in order to get that federal money, governors basically can't cut back on most Medicaid eligibility. That makes a lot of them, well, not very happy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["I really believe that the federal government, with their maintenance of effort, have really tied our hands and not given us the flexibility to do what we do," said Iowa's Branstad. "I don't mind being held accountable [but] I'd like to be able to set our own eligibility requirements."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Utah's GOP Gov. Gary Herbert expressed the same sort of frustration in a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation earlier this month.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["They are taking away the ability to manage the budget," he said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[With the requirement to maintain eligibility "the government is saying, 'Whatever you had in 2010, you've got to maintain that or accelerate it.'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Some Democrats Supportive]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[But not every governor is finding the new health law a negative for its Medicaid program.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Minnesota is actually adding low-income adults to Medicaid this year, three years early. New Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton says that's because the state was already providing insurance to those people, but using only state dollars, so it will actually save money by getting the federal government to kick in a share.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["Easiest decision I've had to make in my first two months in office," he said with a smile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[And while Republican governors continue to argue that the health law is hurting their budgets, Maryland Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley argued just the opposite.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["I think governors have never had more tools to bring down the cost of health care than we do right now, because of technology and the flexibility of the Affordable Care Act," O'Malley said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Late last week, federal officials signaled they would give the states some more flexibility to waive the requirements that they maintain Medicaid eligibility if they can show they would otherwise run a budget deficit. Many governors, however, say they still want more flexibility to decide who to keep on Medicaid — and who, or what, to cut.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Al Keneda lost his vocal cords — and his voice — to cancer 16 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[He remembers the panic he felt when he awoke in the ICU unable to speak, and the challenges of learning to communicate without his voice.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In the beginning, he communicated with a white board and a pen. Then, with something called an electrolarynx — a cylindrical metal device about 3 or 4 inches long that he holds to his throat when he speaks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["I used this for three years before I got my voice prosthesis," he says in the robotic voice produced by the electrolarynx. "It was a barrel of laughs."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Recently, at a scientific conference in Washington, D.C.,   German researchers showed off a technology that might work even better for  Keneda — once it's perfected. The system, called EMG-based Silent Speech Recognition, relies on a computer to construct words by reading the muscles in the face.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Keneda hasn't lost his sense of humor, but living without a real voice wasn't always funny.  Like when he once called a stranger about buying a truck.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["When he answered and he heard me with my robotic voice, he just hung up," Keneda recalls. "He didn't believe it was a serious call.  So I called him back, and he hung up with a threat — 'Don't call me back,' you know.  I'll never know if I would have bought that truck and he'll never know if he would of sold it," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Today, Keneda speaks a lot better. Instead of the electrolarynx, he now has a voice prosthesis — a small valve surgically inserted into an opening in his throat.  When he speaks, he holds his thumb across the opening and uses his breath to force air upward through his throat and mouth to form speech.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But even this prosthesis isn't perfect.  His voice is raspy, and he speaks a bit slower than he used to because he has to take a breath in between each phrase.  And certain sounds still elude him, like words that begin with the letter 'H'.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Everything else you can pretty well do, but the letter 'H' is a bother," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The new Silent Speech Recognition program, which could help people like Keneda, was demonstrated for me by German researcher Michael Wand.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["Let us have dinner at the pub," Wand says.  About a second later, through a set of speakers attached to Wand's laptop, a computer-generated voice echoes back, "Let us have dinner at the pub."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["A good time would be 7 o'clock," Wand says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["A good time would be 7 o'clock," replies the computer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The program is the result of Wand's Ph.D. thesis research at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.  Although Wand is speaking aloud so that I can hear him, the computer isn't listening to the sound of his voice, it's translating the muscle movements in his face into speech via  a half-dozen or so wires connecting electrodes on Wand's  face to a computer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[The idea is that a person can silently form the words they want to say — not actually speak them — and the computer interprets the muscle movements and turns them into sound. One might say that Wand has taught a computer to read lips.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[But there is still a lot to do before this technology is ready for widespread use — starting with getting rid of the wires.  What girl would say yes to a pub dinner with a guy who has electrodes all over his face?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Wand agrees and says that one day the electrodes and the software will be completely integrated into a smart phone that could be held discreetly to the side of the face and produce fluent speech.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[The system currently recognizes about 2,000 words and operates with 90 percent accuracy, Wand says.  Good enough for everyday speech, he says — well, at least most of the time.  At the beginning of our interview, it didn't fare quite so well.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["My name is Michael Wand," tries Wand.  "I would be glad to," replies the computer.  Wand tries again, clearly a little embarrassed. "The recognizer interprets my muscle movements," Wand says.  "The recognizer interprets my muscle," responds the computer.  "Therefore I can talk to you by simply mouthing words," says Wand.  A second later the computer responds, "Sure you can get my data."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[We both start laughing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["I have no idea what's happening.  Maybe it's getting a little bit late.  Electrodes falling off ..." Wand says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Wand tells me that sometimes smiling and other nonverbal facial movements can confuse the system — it's just one of the kinks they are working out to make this a viable product people will actually buy. "We certainly hope to market the system, but it will look completely different then, I assure you."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Michael Benninger chairs of the Cleveland Clinic's Head and Neck Institute.  He says that people who have lost their voices have a number of different choices, but the technology they select is very individualized.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["It's always good to have options.  Anything we can do to improve our patients' ability to communicate is a good thing," says Benninger.  "This may be a good device — particularly for those people who have articulation problems or for those who prefer an electrolarynx."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[And for the rest of us, it may just be a way to have a private conversation in public.  Just make sure no one is reading your lips.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Last year's Best Picture Oscar may gone to a gritty tale amid the Iraq war (The Hurt Locker), but Michael Giacchino's winning score for Up had nothing but smiles.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[That was last year. Now, we've got five new works in the running for Best Original Score. On the eve of the Academy Awards telecast, here's a breakdown of the competition.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"/>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[John Powell, How to Train Your Dragon How to Train Your Dragon is a Dreamworks animated adventure. It also represents the first trip to the Oscar dance for composer John Powell, whose credits include Shrek, United 93 and Green Zone. His budget here allowed for a full-sized orchestra, and Powell knows how to use it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[He weaves four principal themes throughout the score, including some Celtic flavor. He's something of a fearless orchestrator, as well: In one spot, he combines a penny whistle and dulcimer; in another, there are 14 bagpipes. At its core, this film is a romantic adventure, and in John Powell, the directors found a composer who could convincingly deliver a grandly heroic theme.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Hans Zimmer, Inception The next nomination is for Hans Zimmer, who scored the science-fiction suspense film Inception. We talked about him last year when his Sherlock Holmes score was a contender, and he won an Oscar for his 1994 work on The Lion King. With Zimmer, you pretty much know what you're going to get, along with a standard warning to turn down the volume.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Inception is scored for orchestra and electronics. The composer says that he was not allowed to see a rough cut of the picture, and had to write his first draft based solely on the script. He then worked with director Christopher Nolan to fit his ideas into the film. The result is the neat trick of a techno-electronic score with a soul. For Inception, Zimmer does this — at least to my ears — by at times channeling the late John Barry.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Alexandre Desplat, The King's Speech If you like delicate, sophisticated soundtracks, expertly scored, it's hard not to like Alexandre Desplat. His three previous nominations have been favorites of mine: The Queen, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Fantastic Mr. Fox. This time around, it's The King's Speech, about how England's King George VI overcame a stuttering problem.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[You have to love Desplat's sinewy melodies. This music was recorded at EMI's Abbey Road studios, where they found and used three vintage microphones owned by the British royal family. To characterize the king's struggles, the composer wrote what he describes as "music [that's] not going forward." He also couldn't ignore some classical selections used in director Tom Hooper's temporary soundtrack, including Beethoven's "Emperor" piano concerto.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[A.R. Rahman, 127 Hours Composer A.R. Rahman won Oscars for both Best Original Music Score and Best Original Song for his 2008 work on Slumdog Millionaire. This year's nomination is for 127 Hours, a psychological survival drama. It's a mostly moody and melancholy, largely electronic score with interesting threads running through it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The composer says that he connected the film's main character with the sound of the guitar — an instrument that was new to him as a composer. Each of the soundtrack cues containing this guitar music is tagged with the word "Liberation": "Liberation Begins," "Liberation in a Dream" and finally just "Liberation."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, The Social Network The last of this year's nominees is the tag team of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the film The Social Network. It's the first Oscar consideration for each composer; director David Fincher wanted Reznor and wouldn't take no for an answer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[What he got is a predominately bleak ambient soundtrack with faint traces of humanity. There's little continuity in a wildly varied score: For one sequence that's controversial for both cinematic and musical reasons, the composers were told to take Edvard Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King" and give it a Wendy Carlos treatment.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"/>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The Pick Great films don't come with an expiration date, and I continue to believe that Oscar-winning film scores should be held to the same standard. So this year, voting for the score that I think shows that level of skill and inspiration, I'm casting my ballot for How to Train Your Dragon by John Powell.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[For the first time in more than two decades, voters in Chicago go to the polls Tuesday to elect a mayor who is not named Richard Daley. Last year, Daley announced he would not seek a record seventh term.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel is one of the candidates hoping to replace Daley. Although Emanuel leads in both polls and fundraising, the other candidates predict there will be no clear-cut winner and that a runoff is likely.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Here's what all the candidates running for mayor of Chicago want to do: get 50 percent plus one more vote. That's what it will take to claim outright victory.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[During the last full day of campaigning on Monday, the candidates crisscrossed the city.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Emanuel started at a familiar place — one of the city's elevated train stations in the L system.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["It's either 109 or 110 L stops since we started," Emanuel says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[While the train rumbled overhead, Emanuel shook hands, posed for pictures and continued to talk about changes he says are needed to get the city's dismal economy in shape. The latest poll shows him with 49 percent of the support of likely voters, but he cautiously avoids making predictions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["That's their decision on the election," Emanuel says. "My goal is to make sure that they know I've been honest about what the challenges are, honest about what the policy choices are."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Emanuel won a court decision in a battle trying to knock him off the ballot based on his residency. He's raised millions of dollars, dominating the airwaves with commercials. One features President Obama praising Emanuel.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Police in Baltimore are pleading for help to find a 17-year-old who vanished from her family's apartment Dec. 28. Foul play is suspected but there are no leads, and detectives and family members hope media coverage of Phylicia Simone Barnes' case will help them find her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Barnes' cousin, Harry Watson, recently stood on a corner in the chilly sun, passing out fliers to the people hurrying in and out of the tall office buildings in downtown Baltimore.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[A man stopped to ask: "You haven't found her yet?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Not, not yet," Watson replied.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Despite freezing winds, many people stopped to chat with Watson and to shake their heads over the red, black and white fliers he held.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[On the flier, there's a picture of a fresh-faced, mahogany-skinned Phylicia Simone Barnes smiling in the middle of the page.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["We don't pass up anybody; we try to get a flier into just about everybody's hands we possibly can," he said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Those same fliers are posted on the glass doors of nearly every building in the northwest Baltimore apartment complex where Barnes was staying before she went missing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[She had traveled to Baltimore from North Carolina, and was staying with her 28-year-old half-sister.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Police Suspect Foul Play ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["We've suspected foul play from almost the beginning," says Anthony Guglielmi, spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[He says this case has been incredibly frustrating. Officers have searched much of the city, including homeless shelters, hospitals and state parks. They've checked security camera footage both from the apartment complex and from the large shopping mall behind it. And they've put her picture up on billboards along the Interstate 95 corridor.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["What we've tried to do since the very beginning of this case was make sure that Phylicia's picture and our toll-free hotline was put on every media outlet from Baltimore to Las Vegas," Guglielmi says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[With help from the FBI, Baltimore police have even used technology that finds heat signatures given off by human bodies. But they found nothing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["We don't have any physical evidence to help us out otherwise. There's no forensics, there's no blood spatter, there's nothing to indicate that she was harmed in the apartment," Guglielmi says. "We've used canine, we've used every resource at our disposal. Phylicia's trail goes cold at the front door."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"/>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[About Phylicia ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Police say the 5-foot-8, 120-pound Barnes lived with her mother in the small city of Monroe, N.C. Within the past two years, she had become reacquainted with her biological father and her half-siblings in Baltimore. She was last seen by the half-sister's ex-boyfriend at 1:30 p.m.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Her cell phone goes to voice mail. She hasn't used her debit card or gotten onto any social networks. "That was not in her character," says her father, Russell Barnes. He says the high school honor student didn't know Baltimore very well.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Police and Phylicia's parents say they hope she has been abducted — as awful as that could be — because the alternative would be worse.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["We're just keeping hope going that Phylicia is missing. Someone has her and they're not letting her go," Russell Barnes says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Phylicia's mom, Janice Sallis, says she is frustrated and furious that her daughter is missing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["She has a loving personality. She doesn't like confrontation. She's just a peaceful person," Sallis says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Police confirm the parents' statements that Phylicia wasn't a  troubled child who would run away or hang with the wrong crowd. Her  mother says she was a typical teenager who enjoyed acting and having fun  with her friends.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"/>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Keeping Missing Persons In The Media]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[This case hasn't gotten the same kind of wall-to-wall play in national media as the cases of other young, pretty, missing women, such as Natalee Holloway, the blond Alabama teen who disappeared in 2005 on a trip with schoolmates in Aruba.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Baltimore Police Department spokesman Guglielmi says he remembers the Holloway case.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["It's almost like we had a minute-by-minute update," Guglielmi says. "CNN had a little ticker on the bottom of their screen. Everybody knew Natalee Holloway. They knew her picture. Why can't we know Phylicia Barnes?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[But Phylicia's mother isn't concerned about complaints that her daughter's race has affected the media coverage. She just wants the media and the police to work together so her daughter can be found.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[And Sallis has a message for anyone who may be holding her daughter against her will: "For whoever is holding her, I just feel sorry for them from God, because they have no clue of what punishment they are going to get."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Police say they are continuing to question people of interest in the case.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Fifteen million troubled kids who need a mentor don't have one, according to The Mentoring Group, which links troubled kids with responsible adults.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[One program that tries to bridge that gap through paid mentorships is Friends of the Children, founded by Portland, Ore., multimillionaire-turned-social-entrepreneur Duncan Campbell.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["We go to the most difficult neighborhoods and the most difficult schools and ask for the child they don't expect to finish grade school, let alone high school," Campbell says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But do paid mentors make a difference?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Social Worker, Friend, Teacher And Adviser]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[When Anthony Blackmon was 8 years old, he was smart and flashed a sweet smile. His principal at the time, Joseph Malone, also remembers that Blackmon was always "getting into something."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["And he would get angry," Malone says. "And he'd get upset when he got angry. And it took him a while to calm down."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Blackmon's teachers worried that if they didn't intervene early, he'd grow even angrier and eventually join a gang. So they recommended him to Friends of the Children.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Blackmon was paired with a mentor, Earl Fonville. The two hung out together, played basketball and talked a lot about getting control of his behavior.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I learned to think positive and to be the best I can be," Blackmon said. "And I just try to do the right thing."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[At the time, in 2000, Blackmon told Fonville he wanted to grow up to be a Christian hip-hop artist.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["I definitely believe that he can be those things that he wants to be if he makes good choices," Fonville said. "That's what I try to instill in him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Fonville's role was something of a social worker, friend, teacher and adviser — all rolled into one. Blackmon's mother, Cheryl Blackmon, says she could see a difference early on.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["Anthony, before he was in the program, seemed to be angry all the time," she says. "And since Earl's been around him and in his life, I've noticed that that's calmed down a whole lot."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA['It Takes Patience']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Most mentoring programs — like Big Brothers, Big Sisters — rely on volunteers. Friends of the Children stands apart because its mentors work full-time for a salary.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[It's unclear whether that approach is more successful. One researcher at the University of Oregon has begun a long-term study to find out. Friends of the Children reports that 85 percent of its students graduate from high school, whereas the national average is 75 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Education.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Friends Executive Director Judy Stavisky says her program is successful because the mentors get intensive social work training, and each mentor works with no more than eight kids.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["The role of the mentor is both an anchor and a sail for the kids, because these kids have very little of each," Stavisky says. "We provide that grounding experience for the kids. We also open their eyes to the universe of possibilities of the way they could behave and the way their lives can be."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[One of the first steps to succeeding is imagining yourself as a success. Stavisky says the key is sticking with those kids for the long haul, from first grade through the end of high school.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[That was the original vision from Friends founder Campbell. He grew up in the same rough Portland neighborhood as Blackmon and faced challenges of his own — alcoholic parents and a dad in prison. Campbell made a fortune in timber investments. But he says measuring success as a social entrepreneur is a different calculation entirely.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["Like in business, you know what you're doing monthly, yearly and you see the outcome — or you see the reward or the failure," Campbell says. "Here, we don't even know for five to seven to eight years, let alone 12 years, if we've made a real change in a child's life. It takes patience."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA['Pure Gold']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[After 18 years, Campbell's creation now spans six cities, including New York and Boston. The salaried mentorships are costly — about $9,000 per child per year. So was that expense worth it in the case of Anthony Blackmon?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Now 18, Blackmon attends Benedict College in South Carolina. The boy who wanted to be a Christian hip-hop artist is studying music. He plays the piano.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Blackmon says Friends was one of the few constants in his life.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["There were some things going on at home, plus, you know, I had problems at school," he says. "So when I came to Friends, it was like my getaway."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[In fact, he says it was hard to leave Friends. At a goodbye ceremony last May, he says, his mentor "cried like a baby."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["You know, I cried, too," he says. "We shared tears. This place helped me get to a place in my mind, saying, 'I can do this.' You know, I went through the fire. Now I'm coming out as pure gold."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Blackmon says that rather than be in the spotlight, he aspires to be a music producer. That way, he says, he can help someone else succeed.  [Copyright 2011 N3]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As if on a pilgrimage trail, visitors to the city of Yuxi in southwest China pose for photographs beside eight cigarette-like pillars and then in front of a hilltop red pagoda, instantly recognizable to most Chinese from the cigarette packets of the Hongta — or Red Pagoda —  group.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[With 80 percent of Yuxi's revenue from tobacco taxes, this is the town that tobacco built.  In particular, one cigarette brand, Hongta, now owned by the Hongyun group, is responsible for this town's wealth. Yuxi has a Hongta avenue, a Hongta hotel, a Hongta sports stadium — and even a tobacco culture museum devoted to extolling the pleasures of smoking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Tobacco Dependence]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[On a national level, too, tobacco plays an important role, providing Beijing's biggest single source of tax revenue: Last year topped $75 billion. The Chinese government actually runs the world's biggest tobacco company and is intimately involved at every level of this deadly, murky industry — from marketing, sales and distribution down to production with widespread reports of village officials forcing farmers to grow tobacco against their will.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Given China's burgeoning ranks of smokers, the tobacco business has been hugely lucrative for Beijing, with annual profits up almost 20 percent every year for the past five years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["The industry in China is run by the Tobacco Monopoly Administration, a central government administrative body created in the 1980s, also known as China Tobacco Corp.," says Stanford University's Matthew Kohrman, who has researched smoking in China for the past eight years. "This is one of the last bastions of the command economy system. Quotas are set; factories are required to meet them.  Once they meet those quotas they are required to shut down."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The Hongta factory in Yuxi is one of the world's largest, with an annual production of 93 billion cigarettes. According to epidemiological studies, that's enough to kill 77,000 people every year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA['How Could This Be A Bad Influence?']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But despite the fatal nature of its products, most people in Yuxi support the factory, largely because the city is so dependent upon it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Of course the Hongta group's good. It's made Yuxi rich," says Mr. Zheng, an elderly visitor to the museum, who has brought his 5-year old grandson to examine the museum dedicated to smoking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["How could this be a bad influence? It's just about tobacco production: planting, curing tobacco, all the way to cigarettes," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The walls of the museum are decorated with photographs of China's leaders smoking, including Chairman Mao surrounded by a bevy of smiling beauties, vying to light his cigarette. Deng Xiaoping is shown puffing away and quoted as telling Japanese visitors: "I only smoke because I'm so healthy.  I hear there are a lot of advantages to smoking."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[There's a wall of fame for celebrity smokers like Winston Churchill, Fidel Castro and Vincent van Gogh.  There are bronze statues of tobacco growing; there are star-shaped arrangements of cigarette filters; but there are no notices pointing out that smoking is bad for your health.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[China is failing to curb smoking, despite attempts by anti-smoking campaigners. China has a third of the world's smokers, with almost 60 percent of adult Chinese men smoking regularly.  In January, Beijing marked its fifth anniversary since ratifying the international anti-smoking treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, with an admission that it had managed to fulfill only 37 percent of its commitments.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The government just announced new moves limiting scenes showing smoking on television and in films, but campaigners say the real problem is structural. In what is itself a violation of the FCTC, the same government body that develops and manages the tobacco industry in China also oversees anti-tobacco efforts.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["The leadership of tobacco control should change," says Wang Ke'an, who works for the Think-Tank Research  Center for Health Development. "The tobacco monopoly should not be involved. ... It's not so good because they give some interference when it comes to tobacco control."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Tobacco Farmers' Fate]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[On the ground, farmers also report interference, this time by village officials. Few willingly grow tobacco, since they say they can make three to five times more growing vegetables. Surveys bear this out, showing tobacco has the lowest revenue-to-cost ratio of all crops surveyed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[A 2005 investigation by a Chinese paper, the Economic Times, estimated the average income among tobacco farmers in Hongta district to be just a quarter of the average annual agricultural income, well below the poverty line. The most recent official government statistics claim that tobacco farmers earn on average $3,500 a year, but on the ground, farmers say their income is as little as a tenth that figure.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Some farmers do choose to grow tobacco, since there's a guaranteed buyer — the state — and other enticements, including subsidies in the form of free or cheap fertilizer. Tobacco farmer Huang Mei describes how it works in her village.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["The village committee holds a meeting. If you want to grow tobacco, then you tell village officials how much land you will use, and you get cheap fertilizer. They also teach you how to grow tobacco," she says. "Last year there was a drought, and the government gave us water.  If we were growing vegetables, we wouldn't have had such treatment."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[But there are widespread reports farmers are being forced to grow tobacco, miring them in poverty. According to a 2004 survey carried out by Berkeley professor Hu Teh-Wei and some Chinese professors, 93 percent of tobacco farmers indicated that they would not have grown tobacco if they had not been subject to government pressure.  Many say the situation has improved since then.  But one farmer who gives his name as Yang insists that in his village, most tobacco growers are forced into it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["Local officials say they've received a notice from above, and every family has to grow some tobacco. Nobody does it willingly, since it does not make economic sense. We only receive half the subsidies; the rest is siphoned off by officials," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Tax Addiction ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Nobody knows how widespread this is, but several tobacco control campaigners have heard similar stories, and farmers interviewed by the Economic Times said their nontobacco crops had been uprooted by village officials. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration turned down a request for an interview, as did the Hongta group itself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[One thing, however, is clear: Such coercion could be explained by China's addiction to tobacco tax revenues, at all levels of the government.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["A few years back, most of China's rural agricultural taxes were ended. One of the few exemptions, though, is the tobacco tax," says Stanford's Kohrman. "County officials are keen to see tobacco grown, because it's the only way that they — in terms of agricultural production — can finance themselves."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[That system seems unlikely to change. Here's one other reason why: the deputy director of the State Tobacco Monopoly is Li Keming; he's the brother of the man tipped to be China's next premier, Li Keqiang.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Let's nip this one in the bud, shall we? D.J. Caruso's cynical new teen flick I Am Number Four is adapted from the first volume of a young-adult fiction series — Lorien Legacies — and has been conceived by producer Michael  Bay and his buddies at DreamWorks as the start of a blockbuster movie franchise. From all appearances, this first installment cost them dozens of dollars to make, so if fewer than, say, 25 people go this weekend, maybe they'll decide not to make a sequel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[It wants to be a sort of extraterrestrial-high-school-superhero-at-Twilight series, with pretty-boy Alex Pettyfer as Edwa ... um, John Smith, otherwise known as Number Four. (Of nine! Lord help us.) Number Four is a slender, blond teen hunk who's hiding out in Paradise,  Ohio, because there are snarling, tattooed Mogadors (don't ask) tracking and killing "his kind." While waiting for these Mogadors to show up, Number Four spends his time romancing a plucky local (Glee's Dianna Agron) who already has a hot-tempered all-American boyfriend (Jake Abel).]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Think of it as Twilight-lite, except that in this one the vampires have gills. OK, technically, the Mogadors aren't vampires, but they wear black trench coats, have pointy teeth, and only seem to do their dirty work at night — the cover of darkness presumably being as useful for special-effects digitizers as it is for aliens.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Oddly, though they're otherwise pretty sloppy, both in personal hygiene and in work habits, the Mogadors are intent on killing off Numbers One through Nine in strict numerical order. Number Three gets dispatched during the credits. (Numbers One and Two are long gone, presumably to be dealt with in prequels.) And now the trench-coated dudes are hot on the trail of our hero, though Australian-accented Number Six (Teresa Palmer) seems a more convenient target; she's shadowing them, even as they're shadowing him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Dunno where Number Five is. Don't much care, either.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Along for the ride is dweeby underclassman Sam (Callan McAuliffe) because, well, what teen series doesn't need a nerd? Sam settles in quickly as Number Four's number two, a sidekick whose chief function seems to be to smile and mutter "Coooool" when he's allowed to use alien hardware.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[And the Mogadors use lots of hardware — big plastic-looking guns that blast buildings and cars to kingdom come, but never seem to do much to our numbered heroes (who favor long knives for some reason).]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Then again, the writers have conferred superpowers on the Numbered: Number Three could hurtle like a rocket through jungly underbrush, Six can throw lightning bolts in school hallways, and Four's palms have recently started glowing when he gets excited. It's helpful in power outages, though a trifle embarrassing in class. He can also start cars by concentrating really hard, but only after his failure to do so has doomed a guardian (a woefully wasted Timothy Olyphant) whose own powers include intense caution but not a lot of common sense.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[I Am Number Four's CGI sequences are murky and dark, its performances negligible, its script genuinely inept. There is, I should note, a puppy, which arguably keeps the film this side of completely unbearable, but just barely.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The filmmakers consciously avoided revisiting the political debates over the Afghan war, Junger tells NPR's Neal Conan. The soldiers "really don't talk about their politics. But their reality, their emotional reality, is not often reported on. ... We really wanted to somehow give the nation access to that reality."]]></paragraph>

"Many of these young men were going through some of the most traumatic experiences in their life ... living daily with the risk of death, or watching friends die around them," says Hetherington.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It is Valentine's Day, a day when we celebrate love. And even with all that is going on in the world, I think it's important to take a moment to think about our intimate relationships and what we want them to be.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[So, take a minute, if you will, to imagine that you are at a restaurant and you see a man and a woman and she orders, say, french fries instead of a fruit plate … and the man kicks her under the table — so loud, you can hear it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Do you think that's funny?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Or, let's say you are at a couple's house and the woman of the house tries to tuck into a bit of lemon meringue pie or a burger … and her partner shoves her face into the pie, or takes the burger and shoves a bar of soap into her mouth.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[And it isn't funny.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[So why is it funny when it's a woman battering a man and regulating his food? And, for the coup de grace, hurling a soda can at him because some random woman smiles at him as she sits down next to them on a park bench?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[You know what I'm talking about, right? What I just described is the scenario for that Pepsi Max commercial that aired during the Super Bowl.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Now, many of the media writers and bloggers whom I follow seem to find it hilarious, but maybe that's because they've never been to a battered women's shelter, which is filled with women who have actually had men (who supposedly love them) shove their faces into food and hit and kick them over nonsense, like what they wanted to eat.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[And here is a news flash: The fact that the commercial shows a woman kicking and abusing a man does not make it OK.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[And don't get me started on the race factor — the couple in the ad is African-American and dark skinned, at that, and the unfortunate bystander who gets beaned with the Pepsi can, a petite blond woman. Here we go again — that tired stereotype — the castrating black woman; the weak black man; the ultimate object of desire and envy, the petite blond.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Excuse me while I throw up.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[I know there are people who want to tell me it's just a commercial and why are you bringing race into it, and blah blah blah.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But can I just tell you? I am not the one who brought race into it. I can tell you, because I have filmed commercials, that nothing about a commercial is random. Every single aspect — the hair, the clothes, the mix of people, is considered and debated and chewed over. So whoever dreamed up that commercial — and the Pepsico press release tells us it was a 28-year-old man from Kansas City named Brad Bosley — decided that a black woman needed to be the one to issue a beat down to her man to keep him under control.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Now let's compare this with the other Pepsi Max commercial shown during the Super Bowl, which featured a white couple. The woman is dreamily looking at her date, wondering if he wants kids and is nice to his mom. And the man is gazing at her wondering when he can get into her pants. But there's no physical violence.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[And, mind you, Pepsico is the same company that brought us, during last year's Super Bowl, a commercial that featured a little black boy slapping the face of a grown man who was checking out his mom's butt.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[I know, I know, TV shouldn't be that important. TV isn't a baby sitter, let alone a parent. But this is the Super Bowl, for heaven's sake — the most-watched TV event of the year. Moreover, commercials are aspirational; they are telling us not just who we are but what we should aspire to. And kids, as we know, watch everything we do. And many kids — and not just black kids — are being raised in homes with no consistent image of what a healthy, intimate relationship looks like. So they're looking everywhere for clues about what relationships are and should be.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[This is what we're telling them?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[I guess I just have to conclude that this is what Pepsi thinks of black people — they (we) are people who just can't keep their hands to themselves. So please don't be shocked if I just manage to keep my hands to myself when I pass that aisle in the grocery store.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[That commercial, by the way, is called Love Hurts. Can I just tell you one more time ... no, it doesn't.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Tunisia was the first Arab country to throw off its autocratic ruler, inspiring protests in Egypt. While it may take months — and even years — for Tunisia to build a functioning democracy, many Tunisians felt the effects of freedom immediately.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In just the past month, the lives of some have changed radically.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Tunisian entrepreneur Amel Jertila, for example, says things began to change as soon as the plane of leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali lifted off from Tunisian soil, taking him into exile in Saudi Arabia.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["We start to speak and criticize him, and I had a feeling of freedom that day, like something just, you know, it's a fantastic feeling," Jertila says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[On a recent day, Jertila sits in her small office with a big smile on her face. There's an empty space with a picture hook on the wall above her computer. That's where the obligatory portrait of former President Ben Ali used to hang.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"/>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["We wanted to break that picture, and then we said no, we will not break it," Jertila says. "We're gonna go all outside, we're gonna burn it and give a message to the new government. We don't want to have any president picture in the future."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"/>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Jertila says the corruption and fear of Ben Ali's dictatorship was interwoven with a stifling bureaucracy. It was a sort of vicious circle, she says, that no one could escape.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[If you made any profits at all, they were taken away in taxes and government fees, Jertila says. She managed three small companies. She says she had to bribe port authorities if she wanted her shipments to clear in a matter of days and not weeks. And she says the president and his family monopolized almost every business sector — and that those who competed with them were often driven into bankruptcy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["The port was their private company," she says. "The port is not a port. It's them who managed the port. It's them who managed the airport. You cannot describe it. It's bigger than your imagination. They are everywhere, in every single sector."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Across town, criminal lawyer Najet Irgui, 33, also says she has felt the effects of the regime change. She says her profession is undergoing its own revolution because under Ben Ali there was no independent judiciary.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[ "Ben Ali's government told judges how they should decide cases and how they should work," Irgui says.  "Judges would get a phone call, and if they refused orders, there would be repercussions."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Both of these women say that just one month ago they would have been deathly afraid to speak with the media for fear that the reporter might be a spy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[People everywhere on the streets of Tunisia's capital say they are exhilarated to be able to speak freely for the first time. Outdoor cafes have come alive with conversations on topics other than football. But the biggest difference now, locals say, is the happy and hopeful expressions on people's faces.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"/>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Jertila shows off her collection of ergonomic, recyclable office furniture. She says she wants to introduce Tunisian businesses to the "green" concept. This latest shipment of furniture arrived at the port in mid-January during the revolution.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[ "When the port was open again I wanted [to] clear it out," Jertila says about her shipment. "I knew that I had to pay to speed up the job. So I was thinking, I pay, I don't pay. People died for this. I shouldn't encourage them anymore; and then I said — I will not do it!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Jertila told port authorities they had the legal documents to clear the shipment normally, and if it was held up they would have to explain why.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["So I put them in front of their responsibility, and in this situation they were scared," Jertila says. "I got my container out after three days, which is a very, very good sign for me that things are changing."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It's a landmark in the controversial, 30-year-old field of fetal surgery: Surgeons are reporting success in treating a common, serious birth defect called spina bifida — before birth.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Spina bifida is a hole in the spine that sometimes allows a loop of the naked spinal cord to protrude outside the body. Such neural-tube defects are down 30 percent because more expectant mothers are taking folic acid pills and dietary supplements. But about 1,500 babies are born with spina bifida every year, and many are destined to have severe lifelong disabilities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[A new study, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that repairing the most severe form of spina bifida during pregnancy can reduce the paralysis and brain damage that often result when the defect isn't corrected until after birth.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The surgery is delicate and risky for both mother and fetus. Doctors must make a three-inch incision in the mother's uterus to expose the fetus, which is typically about four inches long at this stage. They then put the exposed piece of spinal cord — between the size of a raisin and an almond — back where it belongs, and suture layers of tissue to keep it in place and prevent cerebrospinal fluid from leaking out.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The study of 183 pregnancies shows that children who had the spinal operation in utero were twice as likely to walk unaided later. At age 3, 42 percent of those who had the prenatal operation were walking by themselves versus 21 percent of those who had the surgery after birth.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Brett Hallman is in the lucky group. When he was a 25-week fetus, he was the 55th patient who had fetal surgery for severe spina bifida at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Brett's mother, Tara Hallman, says she and her husband Jake knew the operation was a success months later, when Brett smiled, sat up and crawled on schedule.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["When he walked at 17 months without any braces — without anything — it just took my breath away," Brett's mom says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[A Landmark Study]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[But doctors who treat spina bifida say there's something even more important: Fetal surgery reduces a child's need for a lifelong shunt — a tube to carry cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Without the shunt, fluid can build up, causing devastating brain damage or death.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[More than 80 percent of the children who had the surgery after birth needed shunts, compared to 40 percent among those operated on prenatally.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["From a medical point of view — even though walking is quite nice — for the long-term overall outlook for these children, being free of a shunt is probably the single most important aspect," says Diana Farmer, a study coauthor and chief of pediatric surgery at the University of California at San Francisco.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Farmer says the new study is a landmark for the field.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["This is the first time that fetal surgery has ever been attempted and validated for what we think of as a non-fatal birth defect," Farmer says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Since surgeons at UCSF first did fetal surgery three decades ago, the field has been controversial. "People thought it was quite a heretical thing to do, and quite risky for women," farmer says. "Prior to this, we only considered fetal surgery in a circumstance where either the fetus would not survive pregnancy or the baby would be likely to die soon after birth."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[But she thinks the tide is beginning to turn — partly because other procedures, such as donation of part of a liver from a living relative, "have demonstrated that it is ethically reasonable in certain circumstances for someone to undergo a medical procedure for altruism, essentially — to help someone else."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA['Not A Cure']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[But Scott Adzick of The Children's Hospital  of Philadelphia, lead author of the new study, stresses that fetal surgery for spina bifida "is not a cure. We think that we can help kids."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[There were some downsides: Nearly four out of five babies in the fetal surgery group were delivered prematurely, compared to 15 percent among those who got the operation after birth. So the fetal surgery group had more respiratory distress and other complications of prematurity. But there were no more deaths in one group versus the other.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[One of the biggest risks is to the moms. Surgery weakens the uterus, which could cause a disastrous uterine rupture if the woman goes into labor, though this didn't happen during the study. The uterine incision also means that all subsequent babies will have to be born by caesarean section.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[And as Tara Hallman testifies, even the most successful outcomes of fetal surgery aren't perfect. Although Brett is now an active 7-year-old who swims and plays other sports, he has to work to keep up physically.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[And he has some bladder and bowel problems — but nothing, his mother says, that can't be managed. For instance, Brett can't urinate normally, so he's learned to insert a catheter every few hours.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Tara Hallman says he hasn't let his condition get him down. "Everybody has their challenges in life, and everybody has their battle scars, as we call them," she says. "This is his. And it's something that he's actually very proud of. He loves to show people his scar. It's actually part of his identity."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[If you watched the Super Bowl on Sunday, you saw plenty of promos for the new cop show from Shawn Ryan and the Fox network. It's called The Chicago Code, and it's kind of the flip side of Ryan's first cop drama, The Shield — and it may turn out to be just as compelling.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In The Shield, Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and company were corrupt cops who would even kill their fellow officers to protect their power base and their often ill-gotten gains. Yet over the years, we rooted for Vic Mackey rather than for the various police captains and lieutenants who tried to expose and fire him.  He was like Tony Soprano with a badge — it was easy to like the guy, so long as you didn't look too closely.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The Chicago Code, premiering Monday at 9 p.m. ET, flips that equation.  In this show, the big corrupt figure is Alderman Ronin Gibbons, played by a smooth-looking Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty). He has the makings of a classic TV villain, and he plays each scene with an almost snake-like smugness — like a black Chicago version of J.R. Ewing. Gibbons is the Chicago power broker with his hand in everything — legal or illegal. He recently appointed the city's first female police superintendent, Teresa Colvin (Jennifer Beals), and he expects her to be subservient, naive and easily controlled.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[It's the same logic that got Jimmy Stewart appointed as a junior senator in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington — and Teresa's appointment backfires just as quickly. She, too, turns out to be incorruptible and annoyingly persistent, and decides to target Gibbons with a secret investigation. She enlists, as her major confidante, her former partner when she was a cop on the beat — Jarek Wysocki, played by another Showtime cable star, Jason Clarke from Brotherhood. He is reluctant to come aboard until she reveals her hole card: that she knows Alderman Gibbons is working with the Irish mob, because she has a cop working undercover in that organization.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[There's one other key character in The Chicago Code, at least in its first three episodes. That's Caleb Evers, Jarek's brand-new squad-car partner. He's young, he's smart, and he's played by Matt Lauria, who plays Luke Cafferty on Friday Night Lights.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[All three of these good-guy cops come from excellent TV shows and turn in very strong performances. Lauria is understated but confident, and lets you see the intelligence behind his character's silences. Beals is strong enough to stand firm while dismissing a veteran cop who is furious at her, yet playful enough at other times to flash a quick smile or a quicker insult. And Clarke, as the moral center of The Chicago Code, is instantly likable.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Well, not instantly. The entire pre-credits sequence of Monday night's pilot — that all-important first impression — is so over-the-top it plays like an expensive parody of a TV cop show, rather than a real one.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[But ignore that, let the dust settle and relax, because from that point on, The Chicago Code quickly finds its way. It borrows a little from The Wire, HBO's landmark series about entrenched, corrupted city institutions, and a little from EZ Streets, the vintage Paul Haggis cop series that gave equal weight to its good guys and its bad guys. But those are great places to start.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[And what Shawn Ryan is doing here that is quite original — and may be almost revolutionary — is that he is swimming against the current of 21st-century television. These days, almost all of the smart and best shows are on cable, and the best TV talent has defected from broadcast to cable TV. Ryan, who helped lead that revolution, is now reversing field.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[There aren't many intelligent shows left on broadcast TV, but there are a few: The Good Wife, 30 Rock and Modern Family. And maybe, just maybe — like a few honest cops in a corrupted system — their presence, and their efforts, can still make a difference.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Ohio's new governor, Republican John Kasich, has just a couple of months to deal with the worst budget deficit the state has ever faced.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[For two years, federal stimulus dollars helped offset declining state revenues, but now that money has stopped , and Ohio will likely see deep cuts in government spending.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Even before he took office, Kasich signaled a blunt approach in dealing with the deficit and in public relations.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["They think they're going to be able to carve out their little piece of pork. They think they're going to keep their snouts in that trough," Kasich said last month in a speech to the Ohio Farm Bureau, referring to the so-called "special interests." "If they do, you lose. We all lose, OK. I'm not gonna stand for it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Already a deadline looms: Ohio's fiscal year begins July 1. The law requires Kasich to submit a balanced budget and a proposed new spending plan by mid-March to account for a projected $8 billion shortfall.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Still, Kasich says this is what governing is all about, and in his inaugural address earlier this month, he seemed to relish the challenge.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Get ready for an exciting time," Kasich said. "Put on the seat belt, because we're going."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Kasich spent nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he chaired the budget committee. After leaving Congress a decade ago, he went to work for the now-bankrupt investment firm Lehman Brothers. Kasich also once hosted a weekly show on the Fox News Channel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[He got elected with just 49 percent of the vote, ousting Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. Candidate Kasich tapped into long-term economic anxiety in Ohio, where the jobless rate is just below 10 percent and was in double digits for most of 2009 and 2010.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA['Everything' Is On The Chopping Block]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Ohio State University's Paul Beck says you have to go back to the 1930s to find a budget crisis so serious in Ohio.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["It's a real challenge," he says. "It would have been a challenge for any governor. I think it's a big challenge for Gov. Kasich in particular, because he's already said he isn't going to raise taxes."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[The state of the economy, coupled with the nearly 400,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the past decade, have hurt revenues and driven up demand for services in Ohio.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Kasich says government can work better with less. As for what is on the chopping block, Kasich says the government will look at "everything."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["We look at privatization, we look at killing things that don't work," he says. "There are just no options that are off the table, except tax increases, because we can't stomach them."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Under scrutiny is aid to cities, funding for education, possibly privatizing the Ohio lottery or leasing out the Ohio Turnpike. That's just a partial list. Kasich also thinks that huge savings can be obtained through changes to Medicaid. And he promises to take on public employee unions and their pension and benefit plans.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["And of course, the need to have civil service reform, which is bankrupting a lot of our cities through things like binding arbitration," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Bruising Political Battles]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[The push back has already begun. About 300 people representing a coalition of groups, including unions, protested outside the state capitol recently. They argued that slashing programs puts the burden on working people.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["To the victor go the spoils, and I understand that," says State Rep. Bob Hagan, a Democrat from the struggling blue-collar city of Youngstown.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Republicans control the Ohio House and Senate. Hagan says given the budget situation, it's wrong to continue to give big tax breaks to higher income residents when they've benefited so much from big tax cuts over the past decade. Hagan has a message for the governor.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["I think he has to be reminded he only got 49 percent of the vote — that's not quite a mandate," Hagan says. "I really want him to understand that there are a lot of people that could really be hurt and devastated by this."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[At a statehouse luncheon for Ohio lawmakers from both parties, Kasich asked for Democrats to work with him on the budget — but he also stated a political reality.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["Let's just be honest. Many of you are not gonna go for this budget we're gonna do," he said. "OK, I got that. That's cool. Republicans are gonna probably carry most of the load. I hope I'm gonna be wrong."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Kasich did say to lawmakers that he'd never let political differences get personal.  But that doesn't mean Ohio isn't in for some bruising political battles — and they may begin right away.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Back in August, a recording of Justin Bieber's "U Smile" went mega-viral on YouTube, earning over 1 million hits.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But it wasn't the original song — it was a version slowed down by more than 800 times its original speed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The slow version sounds cosmic and ethereal. Last week, a similar recording went viral, this time a stretched version of the theme from the movie Jurassic Park. Listeners compared it to the early work of Brian Eno.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[As it turns out, almost any song slowed down to the extreme seems cosmic, from Train's "Hey, Soul Sister," to Eiffel 65's "Blue."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Aaron Ximm, a sound artist from San Francisco, tells Weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz it's because slower music forces our brains to "downshift" to a slower listening plane. "You realize you don't have to be in a hurry — you can stay here for a while and take a look around with your ears," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Ximm hosted a listening event in San Francisco last year for one of the more popular examples of hyper-stretched music, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. A Norwegian artist stretched it to last an entire day and called it, "9 Beet Stretch."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["It was kind of mind-altering in a way," Ximm says. "At a certain point, I was aware of living in this slow or almost honey-like time."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It was the fashion equivalent of a first-class prize fight — the Thrilla in Manila, only with high heels, not boxing gloves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In one corner, the titans of French haute couture: the houses of Yves St. Laurent, Christian Dior, Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro and Pierre Cardin — designers known for being elegant, traditional, proper.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[And in the other corner, some of America's best and brightest: Anne Klein, Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass, Halston and a swiftly rising star, Stephen Burrows.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The audience at the Palace of Versailles that November of 1973 was star-studded, too: plenty of American socialites, one of the richest women in France, and the former Grace Kelly, who became Princess Grace of Monaco.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But as important as those ladies were, the event was transformed by the presence of several African-American models. According to Harold Koda, curator in charge of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, at the evening's end, fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert, who had dreamed up the event, described it this way: "It was as if, on this cold night, all the windows of Versailles had been blown open."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Around 200 people will gather Monday at the Costume Institute to celebrate these black models whose work that night made American fashion a contender on the world stage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Koda says many people he interviewed who were at Versailles said the event nearly 40 years ago was special.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["What made the presentation of the Americans so riveting, magical and overwhelmed the presentation of the French was the presence of African-American models," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Sandi Bass began her European modeling career the same year as the Versailles event and remembers how excited she was to hear about black models triumphing in the cradle of the French fashion establishment.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["There was a certain kind of walk that we had at the time, and I'm just going to say it was pretty much the 'black girls' walk,' " she says. "We were free, we were spirited, we would smile. ... It was like a little trot down the runway."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Bass, who worked for Givenchy for several years, says that after Versailles, a number of French designers turned to black girls as models and as inspiration.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Many of the models served as both muse and sounding boards to the designers with whom they worked closely; the old don't-speak-unless-the-couturier-addresses-you protocol was swept aside, Bass says. "We had no holds barred, the personalities just flourished and opened, and this created an excitement for the designers as well as the audience," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Fashion historian Barbara Summers enjoyed a 17-year career with Ford, one of America's top modeling agencies. She says the models at Versailles caught the world's attention in part because of their numbers. There had been black models before, but they were considered exotic rarities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["At Versailles, they had never seen so many flagrantly beautiful black women at one time, so that was a revolution," she says — the turning-heads kind of revolution, not the chopping-heads kind.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Summers says the Versailles audience was used to the chilly remoteness of the models who showcased European couture.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["Black girls changed all that; they plugged fashion into what was happening now, and that meant R&B, rock 'n' roll, dancing, music, popular culture," she says.  "They brought the electricity of popular culture into fashion."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Koda says Versailles came at the moment the world was changing: It was getting younger, there was a lot of social upheaval, and people were ready for change.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Summers says the black models who presented at Versailles were pioneers in overturning an outmoded aesthetic.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["They weren't planning on being revolutionaries, but they happened to be at the right place at the right time," she says. "And for a revolution to take place at Versailles, let me tell you, for these little black girls to be running around, kicking up a fuss, showing off, it had to be absolutely thrilling."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Rep. Gabrielle Giffords has begun the next phase of her recovery.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Nearly two weeks to the day after she was shot in Tucson, the Arizona congresswoman traveled Friday by ambulance, private jet and helicopter to Houston, where she will undergo lengthy rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial  Hermann Hospital, which specializes in the treatment of people with severe head injuries.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[As she left the University of Arizona Medical Center, where she was admitted near death on Jan. 8, people lined the streets and cheered.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["There were several times we could hear applause in the ambulance," says Dr. Randall Friese, a surgeon who made the trip with Giffords, family members and other members of the medical team. "Gabby ... responded very well to that, smiling and, in fact, even tearing a little bit. It was very emotional, very special."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[At the other end of the journey, Houston neurosurgeon Dong Kim was impressed at how well Giffords is doing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["She looks spectacular — in all ways," Kim says. "She came into the ICU and she was alert, awake, calm; she looked comfortable. We were testing the vision; she didn't like us shining the light in her eye, wanted to keep them closed. And these are all very good signs."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Daily Progress]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[In the past week, Giffords has shown progress every day, say her doctors and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Every time I interact with her, there's something quite inspiring," Kelly said at a Thursday press conference at the Tucson medical center. "In two months, you'll see her walking through the front door of this building."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[By the end of this week, she was sitting up in a chair. Physical therapists got her to her feet and even outside in the sun. Doctors said she was able to pick out different stuffed animals and identify objects by color. And people marveled when she scrolled through photos on an iPad.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[When Giffords arrived in Houston, Dr. Gerard Francisco, who will lead the rehab team, couldn't have been more upbeat.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["She has great rehabilitation potential," Francisco says. "She will keep us busy, and we will keep her busy as well."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Indeed they will, say experts in the rehabilitation of brain-injured patients. As optimistic as her doctors are, they say Giffords is just starting down a long and arduous road.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["I tell patients when they arrive that they're going to work harder than probably they've ever worked in their lives," says Dr. Steve Williams, head of rehabilitation medicine at Boston  Medical Center, who is not involved in Giffords' case but has followed it closely. "They'll work to the point of exhaustion, but the payoff is very good in the end."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Dealing With The Unknown]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[There's a lot that doctors don't know yet about the extent of Giffords' brain injury. For instance, they're not sure how much damage has been done to the areas that control her right arm and leg. Doctors say right now they appear severely weakened or paralyzed, so a lot of work will focus on that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[But the biggest questions have to do with her cognitive, or thinking, ability.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[She's already demonstrated that much of her cognition is intact. She can follow simple commands, such as "raise your hand." To find out more, Williams says, the Houston team will need to put her through progressively more complicated tests.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["To follow a command that has many processes, such as 'close your eyes, stick out your tongue and raise your hand,' she needs to remember the sequence of events," Williams says. "She needs to be able to perform all the events, and that's a complex task."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Specialists will also test her ability to think abstractly. That's not easy with someone who isn't yet able to talk. But Jeffrey Wertheimer of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles says there are yes-or-no questions that can get at that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["I may say, 'Does the moon burn your skin?'" Wertheimer says. "I may throw something a little more complex, a little more ambiguous, a little more abstract."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["When you have left-hemisphere damage, going from the left eyebrow area back, one can expect some difficulties with attention and concentration," Wertheimer says. "We may be more vulnerable to distraction."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["The patient does the same task over and over and over so that they really learn and it maps into their memory," he says. "It's kind of like second grade, doing multiplication tables time and time and time again and singing songs so we could remember that two times two is four and two times three is six."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Doctors in Tucson, Ariz., are talking about the day Rep. Gabrielle Giffords will leave the hospital. One of the surgeons taking care of her says she may be just days to weeks from being transferred to a rehabilitation center.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[That bit of hopeful news was delivered at a hospital briefing Monday. It comes after a string of mostly positive news from her doctors since the shooting Jan. 8. But the positive news may not provide a completely accurate picture of what's going on.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Physicians taking care of Giffords have called her recovery to this point a miracle. A bullet traveled all the way through the left side of her brain -- from front to back, doctors say. Just days after the shooting, they reported she was able to follow simple commands. Then, during a visit from fellow members of Congress last week, she opened her eyes. Doctors were almost giddy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[On Saturday, a breathing tube was removed from Giffords' mouth, and her husband Mark Kelly said she smiled.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Mark told me that he thought he may have seen a smile," said Dr. Randall Friese, associate medical director at the University Medical Center Trauma Center. "We're all very optimistic, so we could be wrong. But we all want the best, and sometimes we see what we want to see, but if he says she's smiling, I buy it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[On Saturday, surgeons performed a tracheotomy on Giffords -- installing a new breathing tube in her throat and inserting a feeding tube. They also repaired damage to the top of her eye socket on the right side. Giffords was taken off a respirator, and her condition was upgraded from critical to serious.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["I'm happy to say that within a few hours of the surgery, she was waking up," said Dr. Michael Lemole, a neurosurgeon at UMC. "Through the weekend, she came back to the same baseline she'd been before the surgery -- that same level of interaction she's been having with us. And that's all very good."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Later a reporter asked a question that has come up at nearly every briefing: How much movement does Giffords have on the right and left sides of her body?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["I'm going to be real cagey with you here, like I have been in the past," Lemole said. "The family really doesn't want to go into that detail at this time."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[While a lot of information has been released, it's clear that some is being held back. Giffords is a member of Congress and a public figure, but she still has the right to medical privacy. That means every piece of news the doctors have delivered so far was approved by her family first.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["No one is suggesting we're being fed false information," says Anita L. Allen, Henry R. Silverman professor of law and professor of philosophy at University of Pennsylvania Law School.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["We're being fed information which is positive and hopeful, leaving open the possibility that she might well recover to a greater extent than some of our worst fears might suggest," Allen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Allen contends that the public should be grateful for the bits of information that have been released because under current privacy laws, Giffords family could have said nothing. And frankly, she says, under similar circumstances, that's what a lot of us would want.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["It's a little embarrassing, a little awkward, a little sensitive to have every aspect of one's self revealed to other people when one is in pain, when one doesn't look one's best, sound one's best." Allen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Maybe Giffords deserves a little private space, Allen suggests -- room to heal without all the gory details known to everyone.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Perhaps with that in mind, her doctors say they're not planning any more briefings until there's a significant change in Giffords' status.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[President Obama hosts visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao for a private dinner Tuesday night and then again Wednesday for a full state visit at the White House, including a 21-gun salute and an official dinner with dozens of guests.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Though there has been little noticeable personal chemistry between the two leaders in their meetings over the past two years, the Chinese people themselves were big fans of Obama when he was elected. Now, their feelings are more nuanced -- though still generally positive.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[When Obama visited China in November 2009, he held a town hall meeting in Shanghai that was the hottest ticket in town. Graduate student Qian Jin succeeded in getting into the event and got to shake the presidential hand.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["He's like a rock star, and every student wants to shake hands. Highest moment for me and my friends, shaking hands with Barack Obama, probably is the highest moment," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But Qian concedes, by and large, that on the policy front, Obama hasn't made much difference to either China-U.S. relations or the U.S. economy more generally. He says he thinks Obama was overhyped and that Americans are generally too emotional about their leaders.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["In China, they are so pragmatic. They pay more attention to the real policy rather than the person. We say what people do is more important than what he is saying," Qian says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[And because oratory is not traditionally a part of Chinese political culture, nobody gets all worked up about beautifully crafted speeches, either. Tong Shijun of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences says that Obama as the first black president still resonates with many Chinese.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["President Obama is a positive resource for public relations of the U.S. at the international level, because he sent the message that ordinary people can reach his or her ideals. In his words, 'nothing is impossible,' " Tong says, referring to Obama's "Yes We Can" motto.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Pan Tao, 24, agrees. He says he still likes Obama, and that he prefers him to George W. Bush. Obama may be finding it difficult in this economic climate, Pan says, but at least he's not trying to solve things through war.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["It's not eliminating human contact," says Bob Nilsson, the president of TextMyFood. "There's always a server at the other end. You just want to have that contact sooner. If you can't see them and can't make that contact, rather than waving your arms or getting up, just use the natural communication and let them know what you need."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Nilsson says the goal of the service is to increase the amount of money customers will spend.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Ricky Gervais can't believe his luck. Even after creating a few beloved award-winning TV shows, writing and directing films and cracking people up with his popular standup specials, the host of this weekend's 68th annual Golden Globe awards ceremony is still in awe of his own celebrity and the perks that come along with it. Gervais tells Weekend Edition Sunday host Liane Hansen that he is frankly amazed at the freedom he has had in his career.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["It's not like a career. It's like I've won a competition," Gervais says. "I'm worried I'm dying, and the doctors got together with everyone in Hollywood and said, 'Just let him do what he wants ... just let him do anything. Let him be in all his favorite TV shows.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Some of those favorite shows that have welcomed Gervais for guest appearances include Family Guy, The Simpsons and Curb Your Enthusiasm. He also recently filmed a conversation between himself and Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Louis C.K. -- whom he counts as his three favorite comedians in the world -- which will be edited down for an HBO special.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["I'd be lying if I still didn't [have] a smile come across my face when I see my icon walk up to me and say hello, you know. It's crazy. It's strange. I had a normal job until I was about 36, 37. ... [Now] I'm walking down the corridor, and Al Pacino walks up to me, and goes, 'I just saw you in a terrific film about lying, terrific.' And I go, 'Yeah, you've been in a few good films as well yourself.' It's mad. It's crazy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Gervais hosted the Golden Globes for the first time in 2010. Back in 2004, Gervais won a Golden Globe himself for his performance in the British version of The Office, which was then airing on BBC America. Before that awards ceremony, Gervais spoke with Hansen about his aversion to celebrity and how thankful he was for his relative anonymity in the U.S.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["The good thing is that no one knows who I am," he told NPR in 2004. "They probably think I'm a waiter. So I'm going to wear a red jacket, and then I think the people will leave me alone, definitely. I can't even go shopping for pants now without people looking in my basket."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Coming back to the Golden Globes seven years later as a third-time host and much more of a household name, Gervais says that he will stick to his off-the-cuff style of improvised remarks. He won't follow a script and has no qualms about drinking through the ceremony -- a technique that led to more than a few controversial remarks last year as he introduced celebrity presenters throughout the show.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["I'm going all out," Gervais says. "They will never invite me back again. ... If they wanted someone to read an Autocue, there's lots of better people than me at that. And they look better. So whenever I'm hired, I'm hired for my particular cocktail of skills -- or lack of them."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But more than his role as the master of ceremonies at the Golden Globes, Gervais wants people to recognize him for the things he himself has created -- like The Office or Extras. He knows that after the awards ceremony ends, he'll return to work on Monday morning with his writing partner Stephen Merchant and concentrate on creating his own body of work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Winston Churchill said, 'If you find a job you really love, you'll never work again.' And that's what it feels like, you know. I went from the laziest, least ambitious man in the world to a workaholic, because I can't believe my luck. I cannot believe my luck," he says. "And some people listening to this are agreeing with me."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Since last Saturday's shooting in Tucson, Ariz., Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' district office has become a mecca for mourners and well-wishers, and it has remained open despite her absence.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[On Friday, there was a welcome surprise as Pam Simon -- one of the staffers injured in the shooting -- returned to the office for the first time. Simon, who suffered gunshot wounds to her wrist and chest, walked into a sea of happy faces and open arms.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["I happened to get hit by bullets, but all of you, especially those that were there, you got wounded too," she told her colleagues.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Simon's arrival is the most visible sign that Giffords' staffers can perhaps begin their own healing. Since Monday, they have hosted a stream of constituents, friends and volunteers offering condolences and long hugs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Well, this is a fraction of the type of stuff that has been happening here," says C.J. Karamargin, Giffords' communications director. "People have been coming by from all over the place."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Karamargin says staff members were still reeling from the initial shock of the shooting when they decided that opening the office on Monday morning as usual would send an important message. "No act of depravity would be enough to close down this small little outpost of our government," he says. "The office is open, our government is open, our democracy is open and that hasn't changed."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[So the basic work of a congressional district office goes on, helping Giffords' constituents with their problems, such as immigration, foreclosures and Medicaid denials.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Sara Hummel Rajca handles immigration and veterans affairs for Giffords. She's also the staff photographer, so she was at the congresswoman's side when the alleged gunman started shooting. Rajca managed to find cover.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Not that I'm trying to repress anything, but working through this by keeping the office open is what Gabrielle Giffords and Gabe Zimmerman both would have done," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[The news that Giffords is recovering helps keep the staff strong, Rajca says. But the death of 30-year-old fellow staffer Zimmerman still seems unreal to her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["Tomorrow I want to walk in, go sit down at my desk and say hi to Gabe as he drinks his Dr Pepper as he comes in and chat about the weekend and, you know, have things be like they were last Friday," she says. "But it's not that way and time doesn't stop and we'll just keep going forward."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Somewhere between the feelings of denial and acceptance, there are moments when the gravity of the week is inescapable.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Zimmerman was a social worker before he became a congressional staffer. Earlier this week, he was honored at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., when House Speaker John Boehner ordered the flags flown at half-mast.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Karamargin's eyes well up as he talks about his friend.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["When I turned on the TV and heard that, I broke down," he says. "He said 'Gabe Zimmerman died in the line of duty.' Soldiers die in the line of duty. Firemen die in the line of duty, police officers. First responders die in the line of duty. When do social workers die in the line of duty? It's just, this is tragic."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[As for his own mourning, Karamargin says he really hasn't had time for it yet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Back outside the office, there's a memorial of countless candles, flowers and dozens of placards with poems and prayers. Carmen Mayer, a semi-retired accountant, reads one that brings a smile to her worried face.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["And love will hold us together, make us a shelter to weather the storm," she reads. "That's what's gonna happen. It's gonna take a while. A long time."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Giffords' staffers will collect the placards and the many boxes stuffed with handwritten notes and letters of sorrow and grief. They plan to collate them in the hope that the congresswoman will, one day, be able to read them.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Photographer Bruce Weber is best-known for his shots of models and celebrities. Think Vogue, Ralph Lauren and catalogues for Abercrombie and Fitch. In the early '80s, his photo of Olympic athlete Tom Hintnaus wearing Calvin Klein briefs -- featured on a Times Square billboard -- became iconic.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But along the way in his 30-plus-year career, he has also used his photography to tell other, less commercial stories. In north Miami, he has mounted a solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art -- photos profiling the city's Haitian community.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[It's a community Weber knows well. He first visited Miami on a shoot for Calvin Klein and now it is his home. "I fell in love with the beach and the water," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[And while he came to Miami for the water, he said in an interview at his beachside home, he has been drawn to the streets of Miami's neighborhoods. "People always say to me, 'What's the best part of Miami?' And I say it's people."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Weber tells the story of some of those people in his show, which includes 75 photographs taken over the last seven years in Miami's Haitian community. The show was inspired by a conversation he had with his friend, filmmaker Jonathan Demme after a screening of Demme's documentary about Haiti, The Agronomist. Weber asked Demme what he could do to help Haiti. "And he said, 'Bruce, take your camera, go to Krome, go to the people of Little Haiti.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[That's Krome, as in the Krome Detention Center, a federal facility near Miami where Haitians are held pending deportation. In 2003, he went there with Haitian advocates and was shocked at what he found. Weber has visited prisons before on photo assignments, he says, "but never did I have a chill like I did when I went to Krome. And I saw men just treated so terribly -- just because of where they're from and who they are."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[In the exhibit, there's a portrait of a skinny young man, David Joseph, who was 18 years old when he arrived in the U.S and was detained by authorities. Attorney General John Ashcoft intervened personally in his case, writing an opinion denying Joseph bail bond while he sought asylum. He spent two years in detention before being deported back to Haiti.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[For his journey though the Haitian community, Weber had an expert guide. Marleine Bastien is well-known through her work with the non-profit group she heads, Haitian Women of Miami. She introduced Weber to the community and worked with him like a collaborator. She found that Weber is able to communicate with the Haitian community in ways that other people can't: "He becomes like their interpreter," she says. "He touches their soul and then he's interpreting to others what the Haitian people have been through."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Many of the photos are from 2003, focusing on forced detentions and U.S. immigration policies. But there's another, more recent set. After the Haitian earthquake, among the places Weber and Bastien visited was a hotel in Miami where medical evacuees were being housed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[While there, Weber photographed four Haitian girls, all recovering from disfiguring injuries. They were hesitant to be photographed. But he convinced them, he says, by telling them they're as pretty as Beyonce -- whom he's also photographed. In the exhibit, his photo shows four young women smiling, beautiful, beaming with personality. That was especially so, Weber says with one of the girls, Barbara Adrien.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["Her personality was so strong and so vibrant," he says, "that I can only compare it to the time I was photographing Leonardo DiCaprio when he was a young boy and we went to Coney Island together. And it was just like an explosion of life. You could have taken a million pictures of her."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Weber's show will be at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami through February. He says he isn't done telling the Haitian story, and is planning a trip soon to the island. "I'm hoping some day," he says, "that we have a better story to tell."

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[One of the first issues he faces is a budget shortfall  that could reach $1.5 billion, which is about 20 percent of the state's general  fund budget.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Hickenlooper came into politics after a successful run in the restaurant  business. And today, his public image is just about as amusing as his name. His  political ads get much of the credit for that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[In 2005, he sky-dived in support  of a tax reform measure. And this past  election, when the airwaves were packed with attack ads, Hickenlooper was shown  jumping in and out of a shower, fully clothed. He said every time he saw a negative ad, he felt like he  needed to take a shower.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Hickenlooper could afford to take a risk with his ads in this past election  because his two conservative opponents split the vote, giving him an easy win. But Hickenlooper's image and his  style of governing could become important as state leaders tackle Colorado's  looming budget gap.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I think he has a little bit of the  Teflon that Ronald Reagan enjoyed," says Colorado State University political  science professor John Straayer. "Things sort of slide off of him, and I think  that's largely because he's very affable, slow to anger, and I think that makes  him particularly effective."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[A Budget In Crisis]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The state already had to use  cuts and creative juggling to balance its budget. Federal stimulus money is  running out, and Colorado's expenses will rise faster than revenue in coming  years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[As a Democrat, Hickenlooper also faces a reinvigorated Republican opposition. The GOP took  control of the lower house in the state General Assembly in November. The new  speaker, Republican state Rep. Frank McNulty, is a conservative who  talks about making government live within its means.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["The savings account is gone. The rich  uncle that has been giving us money is not there anymore," says McNulty. "The  circumstances dictate a much higher level of belt tightening than they have even  in the past."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[No one is talking about tax increases in Colorado.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[There are a variety of  constraints voters have put on political leaders over the years that make it  difficult for them to do much aside from making cuts. And that's going to hurt.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In northern New York, General Motors and the federal government have the challenging task of cleaning up a toxic site at one of the auto giant's former plants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Massena, N.Y., is receiving the largest chunk of a nearly $800 million settlement that the bankruptcy estate of GM -- known as "Old GM" -- must commit toward cleaning up its contaminated properties. The settlement is a condition of the federal government helping to give the auto giant new life.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Massena used to be a big factory town, home to Alcoa, Reynolds and GM plants. But aluminum operations downsized, and when GM closed its powertrain plant last year, 500 jobs were lost.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Massena's newly elected mayor, James Hidy, says Main Street used to be vibrant back in the 1970s, when he was an employee at the General Motors plant.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["I moved to Detroit, transferred to Detroit, and moved back after 25 years, and it's just not the town it was. Obviously General Motors has left. Everything downsized. We don't have the population we had anymore, and with that, we don't have the vibrant downtown and storefronts that we used to have," Hidy says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[A regional task force is charged with figuring out how the sparsely populated community can cope with the loss of GM's plant, one the area's biggest economic drivers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["When you pick up the newspaper or you turn on the TV, and you see someone from GM with a big smile on their face, patting themselves on the back on how well they're doing, and you're the person living in the community with the EPA Superfund site and all your people laid off, it's a little hard to be as happy," says Patrick Turbett, who heads that task force.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[General Motors now makes headlines about public stock offerings and electric cars. Turbett's community watches all that from afar as they're stuck with Old GM -- officially named Motors Liquidation Company -- which was created from the bankruptcy restructuring to shed assets, including the former Massena plant.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The plant's Superfund designation means it has hazardous substances in the soil. Anne Kelly, who oversees the Massena property for the Environmental Protection Agency, says because of that and several other reasons, the building will be demolished.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["The facility is very outdated," Kelly says. At 50 years old, the building itself has become a hazard.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["Chemicals that have been used -- paints, mercury switches, asbestos -- there are a number of contaminants that are incidental to manufacturing that will be a waste stream from this facility," Kelly says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Kelly says the demolition of the 800,000-square-foot building -- the size of a really big mall -- will take almost two years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[The Massena site is getting the largest share -- 15 percent -- of the $773 million trust fund. The rest of the money will go to more than a dozen states from the Eastern seaboard to the Midwest, as well as the St. Regis Mohawk tribal land, which butts up against the Massena property.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[After the demolition is finished, the county will try to market the 270 acres.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But Mayor Hidy says he doesn't expect to land another big manufacturer that can bring 1,000 or 2,000 jobs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I look at it as a new chapter for Massena. Manufacturing as we knew it yesterday is just not here throughout the U.S.," Hidy says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[That new chapter for Massena begins this month, when crews will begin scrubbing down the former GM plant to get rid of toxic dust in preparation for the demolition. The EPA says there will be enough money to clean up that site and others in the settlement. But just because those lands are restored doesn't mean all the environmental damage from former GM factories is resolved. The federal government still has roughly 45 unsettled claims of besmirched landscapes that could require cleanup.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[I first saw the fun and frenetic David Wax Museum at the Newport Folk Festival this past summer -- the band had won a contest that got it to Newport. Its  blend of American and Mexican folk music was infectious, and by the show's end I  was already a fan. But when the festival was over, and the Newport  crew and musicians had gathered on a nearby roof to share some smiles and beer, there they  were again: David Wax with his pint-sized Mexican jarocha guitar and Suz  Slezak with her percussive donkey jawbone, making pure, irresistible joy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Wax and Slezak recently came to the Tiny Desk with friends Sam D'Agostino on  saxophone and percussion and Mike Roberts on guitar and upright bass. (That  popping sound around a minute into "Yes, Marie, Yes" is the sound of  his bass bridge collapsing.) Not since Gogol Bordello's visit has it been so hard to keep a band in frame,  on mic and within the roughly six-square-foot area that functions as our performance space.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[David Wax Museum's album Everything Is Saved comes out on Feb. 8, and when the band returns to D.C., I'll definitely see it again. This kind of acoustic exuberance doesn't happen often enough.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Washington, D.C., isn't the only place where political leadership is changing after last November's election. It's also changing in state capitals across the nation, where 29 new governors are taking office. Several were sworn in this week -- including in Florida, where Republican Rick Scott takes over from Republican turned independent Charlie Crist.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Unlike in California and New York, where festivities were toned down in a nod to the economy, Florida's inaugural events bordered on the lavish.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Scott's celebration stretched over two days and included a parade, dinners, breakfasts and a ball. The price tag? Some $3 million -- mostly raised from lobbyists and business interests.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[It's been a tough few years in Florida. The housing collapse has made the state a national leader in foreclosures. Unemployment is at 12 percent -- 2 points above the national average.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[At his inauguration, held outside Florida's old state capitol in Tallahassee, Scott told Floridians he's ready to make good on his campaign slogan: "Let's Get to Work."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Once we take the right steps," he said, "I am absolutely convinced that Florida will become the most exciting place in the world to live and work."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Placing An Emphasis On Business]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Scott is a millionaire and the former CEO of the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, Columbia/HCA. Shortly after he stepped down, the company paid the largest fine for Medicare fraud ever assessed. He won the governor's race by running as an outsider -- spending some $70 million of his own money.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[He has promised to streamline government and weed out unnecessary regulations. In his inaugural address, Scott said the government should be lean -- and do little more than provide a safety net. "Prosperity," he said, "comes from the private sector."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Even before he ran for governor, Scott was an outspoken critic of President Obama and the new health care law. In his inaugural address, he said, "Faced with a deep recession, some say the answer is to expand the role of government. That's the approach the administration is taking in Washington. That is absolutely the wrong approach."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Scott's first challenge as governor will be to come up with a budget that closes Florida's $3 billion budget deficit. To do so, he has floated a raft of ideas -- many of them controversial.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[He wants to cut the state workforce by 5 percent. He has vowed to slash $1 billion from the state prisons, and to reform the state's pension system.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Scott has also promised to phase out Florida's business income tax and to slash property taxes. He'll be aided by the fact that Florida's Legislature is controlled by Republicans -- many of whom share his governing philosophy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[But Lance deHaven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State University, says finding the money for all that won't be easy. "We've got a budget that's really lean as it is," he says. "Many of the obligations we have are things you can't just undo. You're not going to do away with Medicaid or something like that. Even small changes are difficult there. So I just have a question in my mind about how realistic these plans are."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[A Recent Arrival, Now Running Florida]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[As a first-time officeholder who moved to Florida only eight years ago, Scott is still an enigma to many in the state. With his election, he proved that he has determination, money and strong convictions. Floridians now wait to hear his agenda.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[He has said, for instance, that he wants to expand Florida's small school-voucher program to include all of the state's students -- a proposal tried on a smaller scale by former Gov. Jeb Bush, and which the courts found unconstitutional.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Coming after four years of the moderate Charlie Crist, Scott is returning Florida to conservative leadership reminiscent of the Jeb Bush era.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[At Scott's inauguration, Bush acknowledged that the two men have similar views about government. Of Scott, Bush said, "He's an instinctive conservative. He doesn't start with the premise that the government's role is to solve a problem if there's another way to do it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Scott has said he'll run government like a business. He is already finding that doing so presents its own challenges. To staff his administration, he has looked mostly to the private sector, but he has had problems filling many of the jobs -- in part because of the lower government pay scale.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Dr. Billy Taylor -- affectionately "Billy" or "Dr. T" -- died on Dec. 28, 2010. He was the original host of NPR's Jazz Alive! from 1977 to '82, as well as the voice of live New Year's Eve broadcasts, loved for his engaged, enthusiastic, tutorial style. Then, as an Arts Correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning, Taylor added visuals. He would visit musicians at home, in the studio, teaching, running into each other with hugs and high fives. Jazz had been underground and marginal in the media. The light of Billy Taylor's smile, open mics and rolling cameras signaled a new era.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[This was his second great era. Earlier, he was the house pianist at Birdland (1949-50) and accompanied Art Tatum -– the astounding improviser and harmonizer who could not see -- around New York. Taylor was the bandleader for The David Frost Show on TV and host of local jazz shows on WLIB and WNEW. He led his trio, composed and recorded. His song, "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free," was covered by Nina Simone and others. Dr. T earned his doctorate at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, with a dissertation on jazz piano styles that he adapted to radio as Taylor-Made Piano from NPR. There was also a book, which I used as a reference for years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Until his death, Taylor was the long-running Artistic Director for Jazz at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He was the heart of the connection between the Kennedy Center and JazzSet. We feel great appreciation for his leadership and friendship.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[To remember him, we will rebroadcast "Billy Taylor's Diz," his retirement concert from March 31, 2005, at the Kennedy Center. To no one's surprise, Taylor stayed busy and active after this occasion. And, as his musical guest notes from the stage, Taylor does not sound like a retiree; he sounds lively and delighted to play.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[For the concert, Taylor invited trumpeter Jon Faddis to share the stage and to celebrate their mutual friend Dizzy Gillespie (1917-93). Between tunes, Faddis describes meeting Diz. When he was 15, Faddis brought his entire Gillespie collection of LPs to the Monterey Jazz Festival, where Gillespie patiently autographed each one, claiming not to remember several of them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Taylor credits Gillespie for moving jazz closer to Latin music and advancing jazz harmony. Gillespie compositions are the heart of this set. Then, at the end, Taylor closes with "Take the 'A' Train," played very slowly, at the tempo he discovered when he played the tune at composer Billy Strayhorn's funeral.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[To open, we hear an earlier Taylor trio from WBGO in Newark. In the late 1980s, the station acquired a new Steinway piano and asked Taylor to inaugurate it. He promised to play every key, and he does -- fast, flowing, accurate and with ease -- during "The Man I Love."  [Copyright 2011 WBGO-FM]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Republicans roared into the majority in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, swearing in new members and giving a standing ovation to the new Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) turned over a super-sized gavel to Boehner, along with "the sacred trust that goes with it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The mood was light, but Boehner acknowledged that there is a great deal of what he called "scar tissue" from partisan warfare. He said one way to reduce the tension is to give everyone more time.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Mindful of the lessons of the past ... legislators and the public will have three days to read a bill before it comes to a vote," he said. "Legislation will be properly scrutinized and actually sound. Committees, once bloated, will be smaller with a renewed mission."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But legislation set to come to the floor seems likely to kick off new battles. Democrats are complaining about rules mandating spending cuts and about the GOP's refusal to open up the planned health care overhaul repeal to amendments.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Across the Capitol, the new Senate opened for business under continued Democratic control, although with a smaller margin.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) came back with an eye to changing the rules governing filibusters, which tend to benefit the minority. He wants to limit damage to his party's agenda from increasing threats -- often made anonymously -- to talk bills and nominations to death.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["We may not agree yet on how to fix the problem, but no one can credibly claim problems don't exist," he said. "No one who has watched this body operate since the current majority took office can say that it functions just fine."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) is one of the senators battling anonymous obstructions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Nothing is more hypocritical than all the sanctimonious stuff I'm hearing down the hall about the new era, no more business as usual ... [and] we're going to have accountability and transparency. But yet we seem to be embroiled down on this end of the hall with not even being able to get beyond a secret hold," she lamented.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[For his part, Reid is hoping another parliamentary maneuver will help him get a handle on filibusters. He technically extended the legislative day over the next few weeks, to take advantage of the narrow window when a simple majority is all it takes to change the rules.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned him that Democrats could come to regret losing the secret hold if they lose the majority and "suddenly find themselves completely powerless to prevent Republicans from overturning legislation they themselves have worked so hard to enact."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[McConnell's other argument is that the Senate functions as it is supposed to.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["The founders crafted the Senate to be different," he said. "They crafted it to be a deliberate, thoughtful place, and changing the rules in the way that's been proposed would unalterably change the Senate itself."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The Senate has left Washington but will return in a few weeks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[The House is in session Thursday, with the new speaker having ordered a reading of the U.S. Constitution. He also hopes to get in votes to repeal the health care overhaul and the first round of spending cuts before President Obama's State of the Union address at the end of the month.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It may be hard to believe, but the generation that transformed America as it came of age in the 1960s is now entering its senior years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["There are 7,000 boomers a day who will be turning 65 in 2011, which is a significant birthday for sure," says Steve Cone, executive vice president of AARP.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Sixty-five used to be the age when Americans stopped working, kicked back and embarked on serious leisure to make up for all those decades of the daily grind. But just like with every other stage of life they've gone through, baby boomers are expected to transform how we think about "retirement."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Leading the way will be couples like Stephanie and Stan Zirkin. She will turn 65 on May 14; he's already 65, not officially a boomer, but, as he puts it, "close enough."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The Zirkins live in a cozy rowhouse in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Greenbelt, Md. Since their daughter split from her husband, Stephanie has stepped in as a main caregiver for her 6-year-old grandson, Stephen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["To be perfectly frank," she says, "by the time Stephen came along, I was kind of tired out."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[When her daughter is working, Stephanie picks up Stephen at the bus stop after school, supervises homework and sometimes feeds him dinner.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["I always wanted to have a grandchild that I could take care of on a daily basis," she says. "I just hadn't pictured it happening that far along."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Boomers may have bolted for the door at 18 and been off their parents' payroll after college, but their offspring are taking longer to reach traditional milestones of adulthood. Marriage and children come later. Certainly with the bad economy, some are taking longer to establish careers. Growing numbers of 20-somethings have been moving back in with their boomer parents after college, a loving form of financial subsidy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[When the Zirkins' daughter separated from her husband, Stan found another way to help out.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I dipped into my savings and bought her a condominium, which is a hundred yards from here," he says. "You know, I was feeling very secure when I ended my mortgage a few years ago, but now I have another one!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Working Longer]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Stan is a branch chief at the National Labor Relations Board, commuting via car and Metro to downtown Washington each day. He says he loves his work, and despite reaching traditional retirement age, he isn't about to give it up.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["I've spent my entire career doing good for people who might otherwise be powerless," he says. "That's a feeling I can't imagine being duplicated anyplace else."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Stan was eligible for retirement a decade ago. When friends ask if he's considering it, Stephanie has a ready answer:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["Not till they pry the [subway] farecard from his cold, dead fingers!" she says, laughing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[That, too, is typical. Boomers, more educated than their parents, may derive more of their identity through work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[In an AARP poll of people hitting 65 this year, Cone says, 40 percent have no intention of retiring.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["The 40 percent is a much larger group than any generation before the boomers," he says. "But the other factor we see in the poll is that a lot of people feel they have to keep working."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[In fact, when AARP asked what the best 65th birthday gift would be, the top answer was "financial security."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The recent recession derailed retirement plans for many. But Alicia Munnell, of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, says the problem goes beyond that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["We are having a contraction in all aspects of the retirement income system," she says, "so boomers are going to face a much tougher time than their parents faced."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Living Longer]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[A 2009 study by the center found that 51 percent of working households today will be unable to maintain their standard of living once they retire. The reasons are many.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Munnell says because of the rising retirement age and the tax structure, Social Security is replacing less and less of a beneficiary's earnings. Traditional pensions are disappearing, replaced by riskier 401(k)s. Then there's the exploding cost of health care and the shrinking value of homes. There's also the fact, Munnell says, that Americans simply do not save enough. On top of all this, everyone's living much longer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["What we are trying to do is have people save for a 40-year work life for 20 years in retirement," Munnell says. "The arithmetic doesn't work out if you think about it. People just don't get enough income during that period."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[In fact, for those who retire early, it's entirely possible today to spend more years in retirement than you did in your job. Munnell believes those who can should work longer. She'd also like to see another government-sponsored program to encourage retirement savings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Longevity is certainly an issue for Stephanie and Stan Zirkin; each has a parent in his 90s.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["My father is 97," says Stephanie. "He lives alone. He's still got all his marbles, maybe even acquired another few. He's tough."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[The Zirkins say their parents are still financially independent. And, unlike many, they feel they have saved well for retirement. Stephanie believes their sense of thrift may speak more to their Depression-era parents than the rest of her generation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Still, looking after aging parents on one end and struggling children on the other is probably no one's retirement dream. And yet, Cone says, the AARP survey shows an extraordinary -- and characteristic -- resilience.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["Boomers feel very optimistic about a) their future, and b) what they've accomplished," he says. Some 80 percent reported that they are happy where they are in life.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Retirement Alternatives]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[Stan says he's followed with interest some of his contemporaries who've already retired. He's found no one moving to Florida to sit by a pool.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA["One of the guys decided he majored in the wrong subject in college so he's back in college," Stan says. "He's taking anthropology, I think. That's his new love, and he says he intends to stay until he gets another degree, just for the heck of it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["Another one, he always wanted to work with his hands, and so he used some of his retirement money to purchase rundown houses, and he's renovating them himself.  So, they are not retiring. They are simply going to a different stage of their life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Stephanie says this is fine by her; no need to have Stan lounging around the house all day. And really, she's busy enough caring for her grandson.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[So what is she looking forward to in coming decades?  "Ooh," she smiles, "great-grandchildren!"  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The past decade or so has seen explosive growth in the number of social entrepreneurs -- innovators who take a business-like approach to solving social problems. NPR is profiling a number of these people this year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[NPR's Larry Abramson looks at how the movement has matured -- it's even becoming a full-fledged academic discipline.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[On a recent evening, a few dozen people gathered at a Washington, D.C., restaurant to share food, drinks -- and ideas on how to attack some of the biggest problems on the planet, such as hunger in Africa and health care in India.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But this group isn't made up of big-time diplomats or bureaucrats. Many head small organizations they started themselves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The attendees were brought together by Ashoka, an organization that has been helping entrepreneurs launch themselves for 30 years. Among the attendees is a man who hopes to join this exclusive club.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Advocating For Music In Schools]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[David Wish, in his 40s with salt-and-pepper hair, is not fighting hunger or disease. But he is just as passionate about addressing another problem: the disappearance of music education from public schools. His organization, Little Kids Rock, is active in 26 cities. It helps provide instruments and music instruction to kids, at no cost to the schools.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Wish is already a seasoned social entrepreneur, but he wants to become an Ashoka fellow. And it's not because of the cash award. Instead, he wants to be part of the network of fellows devoted to social innovation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Being in the presence of people who have devoted their life's work to that is really an inspiring thing," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Ashoka has been nurturing social innovators for 30 years. People usually become fellows only after their organizations have proven their value and distinguished themselves in the nonprofit world. But as the sector has grown, new groups have begun stoking the fires on the supply side, teaching the value of social innovation to young people.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Incubating Ideas In The Classroom]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[According to one estimate, 500 professors are teaching courses on social entrepreneurship worldwide. On a recent day at the University of Maryland, students took their seats for the final class in a course called "Transformative Action: Effective Methods for Social Change."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Part of the business school's Center for Social Value Creation, it requires students to come up with a viable business idea by the end of the semester.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[One student, John MacDonald, wears a yellow striped tie and a nervous smile for his group's presentation. The Leaf Academy is the group's idea for a charter school that would teach kids about the outdoors.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["Imagine a world where children play together outside," MacDonald tells his fellow students, "where they are given an opportunity to experience nature around us."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[It's a nice idea, but would anyone fund it? To find out, the university has brought in two nonprofit venture capitalists, guys who help fund social ventures in the real world.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Steve Lynott, with an outfit called the 1901 Group, listens patiently to their ideas, and then responds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["My big recommendation to you," he says, "is [to] narrow the aperture. Find a particular problem in schools that you want to look at. Right now it's just a bit too broad."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[After class ends, the other venture capitalist in the room, Drew Bewick of Tree House Ventures, says that just like traditional businesses, many social startups stall because they don't see themselves as a business.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I see a lot of them fail after a year, because they didn't think of that sustainable piece," he says. "They're almost afraid to describe it as a business model."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[For New Nonprofits, New Donors]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Some of the new growth in social entrepreneurship may be coming from donors themselves. Many people with money to give away don't want to hand it over to foundations, who then dole it out as they choose.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Chuck Harris is a former executive with Goldman Sachs who's now working with social entrepreneurs. He says that over the past decade, the wealthy began turning to independent thinkers with new approaches to social problems.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["You were starting to see first-generation philanthropists who didn't inherit the money had made it themselves," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[These donors follow their own pattern of giving. Harris says that many of them "hoped to find the same kind of support for their decision-making in philanthropy that is readily available in the for-profit investment world."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Harris felt the same frustration. So he left Goldman Sachs and founded his own nonprofit, SeaChange Capital Partners. Now he's helping other social innovators run their operations more like traditional businesses. Harris says his advice could include looking more like a corporation, with a board of directors.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[That's a step many are reluctant to take. But many nonprofits fail without good oversight. Gary Snyder, with the watchdog group Nonprofit Imperative, says that because social enterprises rely heavily on trust, they're prone to fraud.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA["Anybody close to the money is typically untrained and not monitored," he says.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Airborne sawdust coated my microphones. The sounds of hard work were everywhere: iron hammers, the roll of rusty wheelbarrows, the shouts of men, the trickle of a water pump, the pull of mud on boots and sandals.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[There in a small part of Kabul's Old City called Murad Khane, centuries-old homes and courtyards were being restored. Long ago, craftsmen had carved these structures out of wood. Years of war and poverty and neglect had left the place all-but-withered and full of trash.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["I had terrible migraine headaches when I was in fifth grade," he explained to his daughter Jennifer recently.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Carolyn Blashek founded Operation Gratitude in 2003 -- the year the Iraq war started. The volunteer-based organization sends care packages to the troops, that include handwritten letters and handmade scarves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Blashek, who has two children, says she was inspired to start the organization by the idea that a service member thousands of miles from home might feel forgotten.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[This year Operation Gratitude sent out its 600,000th package.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA['Sometimes We Feel Forgotten']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The first thing you notice about Blashek's kitchen are the pictures of men and women in uniform, mostly camouflage. They adorn the cupboards and one entire wall. The kitchen counter is covered with mail. The first letter she opens is from a Marine in Afghanistan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"/>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Everyone was so excited when we got the packages. We read through all the letters, shared them together and we were all just so happy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"/>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The thank you letters she receives are handwritten -- sometimes on lined paper, a single piece of stationary, even a torn piece of cardboard. The message is nearly always the same.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"/>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[You have no idea how much one little box filled with random goodies can brighten a service member's day.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Dear Operation Gratitude: On behalf of myself and my entire air traffic control detachment here in Afghanistan I want to thank you for all the wonderful care packages we have been receiving. Not everyone here receives mail that often and sometimes we feel forgotten.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Blashek has kept all these thank you letters, so many they fill a back room.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["One was a letter I got from a soldier that he wrote back to me saying, 'At the end of the day I had eaten the food and watched the DVD, but there was a letter from a little girl in Michigan that meant so much to me that I folded it up. I put it in my helmet and it goes with me everywhere I go,'" Blashek recalls.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[This year, the headquarters for Operation Gratitude is a National Guard armory in Los Angeles where on a recent day hundreds of volunteers were preparing to ship the holiday packages. One corner of the armory looked like a post office annex.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Linda Barber, a longtime volunteer, is in charge of the letters. The ones in crayon and bold print stand out -- maybe it's the glued-on sparkles. Barber, 72, says the letters from the kids often begin "Dear Soldier."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Army Staff Sgt. Matthew Gomez received an Operation Gratitude package in 2007 while serving in Afghanistan. He's still on active duty and stationed at the armory.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["It's just a good feeling to know someone else is thinking of you. Not a lot of us received mail or packages that came in the mail over there," he says. "For soldiers, it's a big deal, receiving something from back home."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Every year, thousands of volunteers back home knit and crochet handmade scarves to go into the troop packages. One of those people is 98-year-old Joan Mazzarelli. She has platinum hair, a pixie smile and on her lap, is a pair of knitting needles.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Since March, Mazzarelli has knitted or crocheted 527 scarves and hats for what she calls her boys and girls in the war. There was another war being fought overseas when she first began this task in 1940, during World War II.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["I knitted not only scarves, but socks and gloves, everything for the soldiers," Mazzarelli says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[She had a beauty shop back then and would knit in-between customers. These days she knits about 14 hours a day.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Mazzarelli says the thank you letters she receives today are not that different than the ones she received 70 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"/>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Eight months after the Upper Big Branch mine disaster, the families of the 29 coal miners who lost their lives continue to live in grief, yet few have described their pain publicly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["Here in southern West  Virginia [we] tend to keep that stuff closely held," said Randolph McGraw, a lawyer in Beckley, W Va., who represents the families of six Upper Big Branch victims.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["[We] understand the risk … when something ultimately happens that is beyond the comprehension of people from other parts of the country," McGraw said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But Gene Jones believes speaking out is critical, especially as public memory of the tragedy fades. Jones, 50, lost his identical twin Dean in the explosion.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["We're just going to be forgotten," Jones says, while mine disasters are "going to continue and continue and continue to go on. We need it fixed."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[So Jones agreed to describe his family's ordeal, hoping that mine safety regulators, state and federal investigators, the mining industry, Congress and Americans in general will be reminded of the human cost of the nation's worst mine disaster in 40 years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["They mourn for you," Jones notes, "and it's unbelievable how this nation came together. But if [we] don't speak out and continue to speak out, it's just forgotten."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[A Reflection Of The Loss]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Gene and Dean Jones were so close in their mother's womb doctors detected just a single heartbeat.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I was 10 minutes older than Dean," Gene said. "It's like part of me is gone."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I think about him every day," Gene said from a conference room at Appalachian Power in Beckley, where he works as an electrical engineer. His hazel eyes welled with tears. "So I work a lot not to think about it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[An obituary Gene wrote for his brother that includes an image of Dean, broadly smiling, sits on the table. If it wasn't for Dean's mustache, the twins would look exactly alike.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Still, when Gene looks in the mirror he sees his brother.  "When people see me they see me and Dean," Gene adds, referring to Dean's widow Gina and their now 14-year-old son Kyle.  "When Kyle sees me he sees his daddy some and when he listens to me talk, he probably thinks, 'Whoa, that's my dad!'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[On April 5, Dean Jones went four miles inside the Upper Big Branch mine to an area called Headgate 22. Dean was a section boss and mining engineer with 30 years underground. He and his crew of eight miners were using a continuous mining machine to dig the entryways or tunnels needed to get the area ready for mining.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Dean and Gene went to school together all the way through engineering studies. They shared three paper routes as kids and spoke in rapid conversations nobody else could understand. They both followed their late father Dallas into the mines and Dean loved it. But Gene couldn’t take the dusty, dark and confined conditions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["These men were doing something that nobody else wanted to do because it's a scary, dangerous job," Gene says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The Disaster]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[While Dean was underground late that afternoon, Gene sat on his porch in Beckley about 20 miles away. He had just mailed his tax return at the post office, and was blissfully unaware of the emergency calls that started pouring in.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[When Gene's phone rang, his youngest sister Cheryl was on the line, frantic.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["They had a mine explosion at Upper Big Branch," she told her brother.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["You can't believe the feeling that went over me," Gene said. "It just scared me."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Dean's wife Gina and his sister Judy joined the miners' families gathering near the mine. Gene stayed with his 83-year-old mother to help her through the ordeal.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["It went on for days waiting on whether Dean was alive or not," Gene remembers. "It was just awful."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[It was eerily familiar. Families gathered for vigils and stayed glued to television news.  "It was just hard to believe that my family was looking at this, facing this," Gene says, "and wondering is my brother going to come out alive?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Dean's decades of mining experience and his location in the mine bolstered the family's hope.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["I know that my brother was at the furthest point away from the explosion, a few hundred feet from the safety area" Judy told the Today show.  "He would have felt the concussion.  He would have felt the sucking of the air.  He would have known that that was possibly fatal for them and he would have taken his men to the safety area."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[The safety area is a rescue chamber stocked with food, water and oxygen.  And even after rescue teams had found the bodies of most of the men on Dean's crew, there was hope that he and three others might be safe.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[But shortly after midnight on April 10, five days after the blast, Judy and Gina burst through the door with the terrible news.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Gene describes the scene, sighing deeply between words and sentences.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["Gina was screaming and hollering, saying 'I couldn't bring him home. I just couldn't do it.'  And then I knew he was gone," Gene remembers. "And it was just chaotic at the house, just crazy.  And we all just broke down and cried."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Later, the Jones family was told that Dean was gone in an instant. The blast hit him face first and came back and hit him again as the concussive forces bounced around in the confined spaces underground.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[As an engineer, Gene knows what those forces can do. "He was like a rag doll," Gene says. "Use your imagination." The condition of Dean's body, he suggests, is too horrible to describe.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Seeking A Safe Future]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[With the holidays coming, Gene anticipates gloomy family gatherings. "It's really hard to think about that," he says. "We never dreamed he would not be here. It's so unexpected. So now we're having to deal with it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[Gene's sadness turns to anger and frustration as he recalls Dean's complaints about safety problems at Upper Big Branch. Alice Peters, Dean's mother-in-law, testified in a congressional hearing in Beckley in May that Dean had been threatened with dismissal seven times because he resisted putting his crew in danger.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["Dean needed his job to make sure his son could get the medical care he needed," Peters testified. That's a reference to Kyle's cystic fibrosis and the health insurance Dean's job provided.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Peters also told the congressional committee that Dean's wife does not go out unless Peters is with her, "and then she just cries the entire time."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[Kyle turned down his father's bed sheets at night, Gene notes, and sometimes crawled in with Dean so the two would be together before it was time to get up for work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[Gene considers his own son, who also works in a coal mine.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA["I want to make sure that he comes home every day," he says. "And since this happened, I call my son every day at two o'clock or he calls me before he goes into the mine so I can hear his voice."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA[Gene reflects on the eight months since Dean Jones and 28 other brothers, fathers, sons and grandfathers died. Congress rejected mine safety reform, he says. The civil and criminal investigations of the Upper Big Branch explosion drag on. And he wonders about the value Massey Energy has placed on his brother's life. Departing CEO Don Blankenship, he notes, is getting a golden parachute worth at least $12 million -- four times the settlement the company offered to the Jones family.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA["It's so sad to hear these crazy things," he says. The miners "were there every day risking their lives for that black coal, for us, surviving in this country."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[Gene Jones pauses with a massive sigh. "And because of that," he continues, "I lost my brother."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Moody's name and career are forever linked to "Moody's Mood for Love," the minor hit single that inspired singer Eddie Jefferson to set Moody's improvisation to lyrics. Van Morrison, George Benson and Queen Latifah are among at least a dozen artists who have covered the song.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The jazz great was also known for his skillful, soulful improvisations on flute and various saxophones. Moody kept performing and touring until recently, when his illness made it impossible.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Moody's life began with interesting challenges. In 1996, he told Terry Gross, host of WHYY's Fresh Air, that he was born partially deaf.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["It doesn't mean that I have a speech impediment," Moody says. "It's just that I don't hear S's. Because my wife always tells me when I'm singing '[Moody's] Mood for Love,' I'd say, 'You give me a smile,' and it sounds like 'You give me a mile.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Moody couldn't hear certain high notes as a child, but it didn't dampen his love for music. He listened to big bands -- especially the saxophonists -- on the radio.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Moody told NPR in 1997 that he used to spend a lot of time standing outside the windows of his neighborhood music store in Newark, N.J.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["I used to look at the saxophones every day," Moody said. "I'd just look at 'em, you know. And when I first got my first saxophone, I put it in bed by me and just used to sleep with it, man. Just looking at it."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Bebop legend Dizzy Gillespie heard him on a military base in North Carolina and hired him for his bebop big band after Moody was discharged.

Moody says a two-week trip to Paris turned into a three-year stay.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[During that time, Moody recorded an album in Sweden and experienced a minor hit in 1949. He used a borrowed alto saxophone and improvised over the chord changes to the pop song "I'm in the Mood for Love." His improvisation never stated the melody and was released as "Moody's Mood for Love." It inspired a couple of jukebox hits based on his performance, as he explained to Marian McPartland on NPR's Piano Jazz in 1997.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Singer Eddie Jefferson turned Moody's improvisation into words, and King Pleasure's version of the tune became an even bigger hit in 1952.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Moody would lead his own groups and albums in the decades that followed. For the better part of the 1970s, he played in Las Vegas show bands and watched his daughter grow into a teenager. He would continue to work in jazz ensembles led by his lifelong friend and mentor Dizzy Gillespie, and he became known for sophisticated, soulful solos on flute, alto and tenor saxophones.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[He was respected by jazz musicians for constantly practicing and striving to improve himself as an artist. Trumpeter and educator Jon Faddis says he first met Moody when Faddis was a skinny teenager cracking corny knock-knock jokes around Oakland, Calif. Some 30 years later, Moody presided over Faddis' wedding in 2001 in a B'hai ceremony. Faddis says he's long admired both the artist and the man.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["Younger musicians like Antonio Hart and myself will look at Moody and see someone who is always searching and learning more about music and life, and is always willing to share what he knows about music and life with others," Faddis says.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Jazz saxophonist and flutist James Moody, who began his career playing bebop with Dizzy Gillespie's Big Band and recorded for more than 60 years, died Thursday. He was 85.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Moody first became known for his 1949 recording of the song "I'm in the Mood for Love." His reworking of the melody was so powerful, it became the melody for a new song with lyrics by Eddie Jefferson, called "Moody's Mood for Love."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[That song began, "There I go, there I go, there I go..." and became a standard for both Moody and other jazz singers. In a 1996 interview on Fresh Air, he described the impact "Moody's Mood" -- which was named to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001 -- had on the rest of his career.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["If I don't do it to this day,' he said, "people say I haven't been there. That goes to show you, no matter how much I practice, if I don't say, 'There I go, there I go,' then it's like I haven't been there. ... I love doing it, and it's been very good to me, that solo. And I'm honored and privileged, I believe, to be able to do it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Moody began his career in 1947, in the early days of bebop, playing with Dizzy Gillespie's Big Band. By the end of the '40s, he'd left the group and moved to Europe. He returned to the U.S. in the early '50s to lead his own band -- and played with Gillespie again for much of the '60s. But in the '70s, Moody left the jazz scene to work a steady job in a Vegas hotel band. When he returned to the jazz world in the late '70s, critic Gary Giddins wrote that "there were few living musicians [he] enjoyed hearing perform more than Moody."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[In 1998, the National Endowment for the Arts named Moody a Jazz Master. His last album, Moody 4B, was released in 2010.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[For  decades, there was a gold standard for identifying hits: the Billboard Hot 100.  But people hear and buy music in many different ways now, and that's changed  the calculus of hits. The chart, which has long been based on sales and radio spins, recently started reflecting online streaming, too.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["I think that actual radio itself  is becoming irrelevant in what creates artists because of the Internet and  because of grass-roots campaigns," says Evan Bogart, who has written hits for  Rihanna and Beyonce. He says he cares more about radio play than sales, but there's  something even more important to him -- fans talking about a song  online.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Exhibit A is Justin Bieber, undeniably one of the biggest stars this year. His latest single is called "U  Smile." Jerry Wonda produced it, and it has spawned more than 17 million views on YouTube. But this week, the song is nowhere to be found on the charts.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Bieber is probably the best example of the way a young fan base is changing the definition of a hit. "Baby" was a smash -- it's the most viewed  YouTube video of all time -- but it peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. In a new list of the 100 biggest songs of 2010 published by Billboard, "Baby" doesn't appear until No. 44.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Catherine Brewton is a vice  president at BMI, the songwriters organization. She says it's a mystery to her  that Justin Bieber songs don't get played on the radio very much. But, she  says, "In this case, radio really  doesn't matter that much."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[To deal with the Bieber paradox,  last week Billboard introduced yet another new chart -- the Social 50. It ranks  musicians' popularity by looking at sites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. On that chart, Justin Bieber is No. 2.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[It's one of the top  ringtones this week. The video that teaches you the dance has more than 2 million  views on YouTube. Famous rappers dropped verses on the remix. But is it a hit?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[We've asked you before: How do you know if a song is a  hit? It could be a combination of sales, radio plays, YouTube views, online  conversation, cellphone rings and dance-floor domination. But maybe you have a  different tell.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Fridley and her daughter now live in their own apartment -- but only because a New York state program pays for Fridley's personal care attendants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Attendants are my arms and legs. I wouldn't be able to do anything without my attendants. They help me to get bathed in the morning. They get me dressed. They attend to my, both my, you know, urinary and bowels; my personal needs. They help me to cook. They drive me from doctors' appointments to wherever I need to go, and I like to get out," Fridley said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Since her injury, there have been three times when she almost went into a nursing home. One came earlier this year when officials in New York proposed cutting the attendant care program. After Fridley and others protested -- and she told her story to New York Gov. David Paterson -- the decision was reversed. However, more state cuts are expected next year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[According to a study by the AARP Public Policy Institute, the cost of attendant care is about a third the cost of providing care in a nursing home or institution. But there's an upfront cost to states to hire the case managers and aides, find the housing, and pay for other things that make this home-based care work. And states worry that more people -- who now depend upon family to provide the care to keep them out of nursing homes -- will start demanding this care at home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So as states face record budget gaps, the programs that help people live at home are cut.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Nancy Miller, at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, thinks that may be one reason the percentage of 31- to 64-year-olds is growing in nursing homes. Miller, an associate professor in the school's department of public policy, has been studying why young people enter nursing homes and published several reports documenting these data. She has found that it's also this same group going into nursing homes at higher rates. It's a trend she has found in almost every state over the past 10 years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["They were much more likely, relative to their older counterparts, to have a diagnosis of diabetes and renal failure," Miller said. "And then I also found that a substantial share came in with a mental health problem."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Miller says that shows states lack programs to help these people receive care at home. And when such support exists, it's hard to find.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Pat McMurry, who runs a nursing home outside Atlanta, agrees that it's the availability and funding of state programs that has caused the growth of working-age people in nursing homes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["I've been in this business for almost 50 years now," McMurry said. "And traditionally, nursing homes were the little old men or the little old ladies that either outlived their relatives or had some kind of a fall or a fracture. Now we're seeing a transition to a younger population, either for psychiatric issues, which once upon a time were addressed in psychiatric state hospitals, which a lot of those have closed. So this is really the only means available that are financially reimbursed."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Fighting 'Institutional Bias' ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Over the past 20 years, federal laws and policies have established a civil right to get long-term care at home. But NPR's investigation found that is only sporadically enforced.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[More than 60 percent of what states spend on long-term care for the elderly and disabled goes to pay for people -- like Michelle Fridley -- to live in a nursing home. The amount spent on home-based care has grown steadily, but not nearly enough to meet the need. Nationwide, there are some 400,000 people on state waiting lists for home-based care, double the number 10 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[At a protest in Washington last spring organized by ADAPT, a disability civil rights group, Fridley and her daughter, then 9 years old, participated. The group wants Congress to make it mandatory that states pay for people with disabilities -- young and old -- to live in their own homes. That means expanding state programs that pay for in-home attendants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"/>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The protesters blocked federal office buildings and ones that house groups representing state lobbyists and the private nursing home industry. On the back of Fridley's power wheelchair, a hand-lettered sign said: "I'd Rather Go To Jail, Than Die In a Nursing Home."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"/>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[She had also stuck a round sticker on her coat that said "Defending Our Freedom." That freedom is the civil right to get their long-term care at home. It was established by a 1999 Supreme Court decision in what's known as the Olmstead case. The court cited the Americans with Disabilities Act, the sweeping anti-discrimination law that is mostly thought of as something that puts wheelchair ramps on buildings and tells employers they can't discriminate in hiring decisions against the disabled.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[But the Supreme Court justices said the provisions of the ADA also make the unnecessary institutionalization of people with disabilities a form of discrimination.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Since then, federal policies have said states need to do more to meet the obligation that resulted to create more community-based care. The recent health care overhaul has several provisions to create financial incentives for states to expand these attendant-care programs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[But there is a contradiction in federal law. Policymakers call it the "institutional bias." Federal law requires states to pay for nursing homes, while community-based care is optional.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Fridley and the other members of ADAPT demanded that lawmakers pass the Community Choice Act, which would end the "institutional bias" in Medicaid and make it mandatory for states to pay for home-based care, just like it is a requirement to pay for nursing home care now.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[A pilot program was included in the recent health care overhaul, but it's voluntary for states. The larger bill has languished in Congress. One reason: The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost $5 billion a year. Some academic studies have said much of that money would be offset by the cost savings of caring for people at home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Janice Zalen, with the American Health Care Association, the largest association of long-term care providers, says that nursing homes play an important role filling a gap for people who don't have other choices or who can't easily put together in-home services.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[She also notes that who lives long-term in nursing homes is changing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[One reason is the rise in assisted living, a more homelike alternative. Residents get their own, private apartment, but there are nurses and aides to help, too. Nearly 1 million Americans reside in assisted living; more than 1.5 million live in nursing homes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Zalen says people who are less disabled -- and who can afford to pay for expensive assisted living -- are leaving nursing homes. The people who stay in nursing homes are poorer and sicker.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["If you go into assisted living, you'll often see people that used to be in nursing facilities. And what they say about the nursing-level people, they used to be in hospitals," she said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[And for people who are poorer and sicker, there's a big advantage to being in a nursing home: You don't have to pull together all kinds of services. All the care is under one roof.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA["It's automatic, it's just there," Zalen said. "You have your physician ... there. The nurses are there; the nurse aides are there; the dietitians are there. Everybody that needs to be there is there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[By federal law, people who face going into a nursing home must be told about alternatives. But in Miller's study in one state, nearly 30 percent of younger people in nursing homes said they weren't told about options. Often doctors and other health care providers just don't know what's available -- and recommend a nursing home instead.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Moving From Family Care To Independence]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[Those who don't go into a nursing home often rely on care from family members -- who provide it at no charge to the state, but at a cost that can be their health, time and stress.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[That's what happened to Michelle Fridley's mother, who cared for Michelle and Felicia for several years after the accident.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[The first time Fridley almost went into a nursing home was right after her accident. She said discharge planners at the rehab hospital waited for a moment when her mother wasn't around.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA["I was pulled into a meeting at the hospital," Fridley recalls. "And they recommended that I not put the burden on my family: 'Think of what you're doing to your mom.' And they recommended that I go in the nursing home. I said, 'Oh, if my mom hears this she's going to hit the roof.' She was working so hard so I didn't go into a nursing home."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[Fridley's mother, Pat Plyter, moved to a house that could be made wheelchair accessible. When Fridley finished her rehabilitation at the hospital, she and her daughter moved in with Plyter.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[Plyter found herself waking up at night to care for both her adult daughter and for her newborn grandchild. A state program paid for attendants, but mostly just three hours a day. Fridley's two nieces also helped.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA["When she was in her accident, I just prayed to God to give me the strength to do it," said Plyter. "It was extremely hard. I cried a lot."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[Fridley needs someone to turn her body in bed when she's in pain. So her mother stayed up all night, and then went to her job -- as a hospital nurse -- in the morning. The late hours took a toll on Plyter, mother and daughter agree. And in recent years, as Fridley needed more help, while her mother got less sleep.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[The constant caregiving created friction in the household: Plyter noted there was relief for her daughter, but not much for her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA["She would have a lady come in during the day and give her a shower, a pedicure and a manicure and put her makeup on," Plyter says. "I couldn't even do that and she'd sleep during the day and I didn't have sleep."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="48"><![CDATA["It was to the point where she wasn't even showering," says Fridley. "And it was because she really didn't have time. I was really depressed and I really hated what I was doing to my mom."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="49"><![CDATA[Fridley worried, too, that as Felicia got older, she would feel forced to take on more of the care. So a little over a year ago, Fridley made a desperate decision: It was time to go into a nursing home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="50"><![CDATA[But after discovering the Center for Disability Rights, a disability advocacy group in Rochester, she was able to move to a new apartment. The group, along with her local state senator, helped her move to a nearby county, where she could receive funding to live independently.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="51"><![CDATA[The money paid for a small apartment where she now lives with Felicia, and attendants who are there 20 hours a day. She even hired her two young nieces, who used to do a lot of the work free.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="52"><![CDATA[Fridley says this has been the difference between going into a nursing home and living what she considers a normal life. She's raising her daughter, she volunteers at Felicia's school and she's getting a degree in health care management through an online university. She works as a volunteer advocate at the disability group that helped her. And this year she was named Miss Wheelchair New York.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="53"><![CDATA["I've never been happier," Fridley says. "I have never been healthier. And I'll say that again: I've never been healthier. I've never been more excited. I'm living my life to the fullest."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="54"><![CDATA[She has also become a volunteer advocate, working at the disability center that helped her. Earlier this year, when the state of New York proposed cuts in the hours of attendant care that people like Fridley could get, she was one of a group that went to the state capitol and met with Paterson. Fridley told him her story of trying to stay out of the nursing home. The program was saved.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="55"><![CDATA[But more cuts are expected next year. So Fridley keeps up her advocacy. Because, if the cuts go through next time, Fridley fears she'll be forced to leave behind her normal life -- and give up Felicia -- joining the growing number of working age adults who are going into nursing homes.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As scientists monitor what the long-term impact of the BP oil spill will be on the Gulf of Mexico, sociologists and psychologists are working to mitigate the spill's impact on the psyche of Gulf Coast residents.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But they're finding it takes a special effort to reach some communities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In the fishing village of Bayou La Batre, Ala., crisis counselor Le Huong Carter steps onto a porch and takes her shoes off before she knocks on the front door. She's Vietnamese and works closely with the Southeast Asian refugees who have settled on this working coastline, south of Mobile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[A young woman answers the door and smiles when she sees Carter.  Phuong Khuu, also from Vietnam, is a widowed mother of two.  She used to work picking crab in the seafood processing plants that line the bayou.  But now, she says, her days are filled with cooking, cleaning up the house, and taking care of her kids.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["And waiting on BP," she says. "They pay the money."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Since June, she has been living on payments from the BP claims fund, and staying up nights thinking about the future.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["I can't sleep," Khuu says. "I worry [at] nighttime. I'm scared."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Sleeplessness is just one of the symptoms that researchers say have spiked since the BP oil spill. Several studies have found that more than a third of Gulf Coast residents report higher levels of anxiety, stress, anger and depression.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[The uncertainty in the aftermath of the disaster has taken a toll on people who relied on the Gulf for their livelihood, according to Tonya Fistein, a therapist with AltaPointe Health Systems in Bayou La Batre. She says there are many unanswered questions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["When they do get back to work, is it going to be safe?" she asks. "Are they going to be able to sell their product? There is all of this if, if, if and what if?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Most of the Gulf of Mexico is back open for fishing.  But the market hasn't been there for the seafood, so the industry has yet to rebound.  For Vietnamese immigrant Phuong Khuu, finding other work is nearly impossible because of her limited English skills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["In seafood," Khuu says, "no talk, no read, no write. I just need a strong hand."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Counselor Le Huong Carter has enrolled Phuong Khuu in English classes, and is trying to help her in other ways.  Carter is part of an oil spill crisis team put in place this summer by AltaPointe Health Systems. They've set up group sessions and other programs to get people talking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But Khuu resists structured therapy as a way to deal with her anxiety. Carter says there's a real cultural barrier when it comes to mental health in the Amerasian community. "Depress[ion], anger or hurt are suppressed within the culture," Carter says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[There's no middle ground where people can explore why they're struggling emotionally in the aftermath of the oil spill.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["There is no concept," Carter says. "Either people are healthy or they are very, very, very broken down. People would say that person is 'coo-coo' ... or very crazy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Counselors have also discovered a religious reluctance from those who practice Buddhism to seek help.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["If they are experiencing difficulties, a lot of them feel this is a necessary thing to experience," says AltaPointe therapist Pam Maumenee. "And if they don't walk the path now, the next life won't be better, so they should pay this price."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Figuring out how to break through the cultural barriers has been a real challenge, Maumenee says. One way she tries is to start the conversation about physical, not behavioral, needs. Talking about problems with housing or utilities can lead to other issues going on in the family.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["Maybe anger is increasing," she says. "There may be substance abuse going on.  Domestic violence -- we've seen an increase in domestic violence."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast (and soon of the magazine Newsweek), checks in again for the recommended-reading feature Morning Edition calls Word of Mouth. This time Brown points to a book and a pair of articles about people who embodied heroism in three eras: a biography of Lawrence of Arabia, a review of The King's Speech and an admiring profile of Elizabeth Edwards.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA['Hero: The Life And Legend Of Lawrence Of Arabia']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Michael Korda's new book "is just the most gorgeous biography of Lawrence of Arabia," Brown says, citing the author's "accessible style" and his "fabulous eye for the gossip and the detail." And then, of course, there's the voice of Lawrence himself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["So it's a really juicy read -- I did love this book," Brown says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[T.E. Lawrence was a British military officer at the time of World War I. He'd go out virtually alone -- sometimes absolutely alone -- into the Arab desert, recruiting restive Bedouins to instigate a revolt against the Turks, who controlled the territory.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[What was incredible about Lawrence, says Brown, was how "he sort of understood, mastered and initiated this whole notion of counterinsurgency all those years ago. I mean, he understood how to penetrate, how to woo, how to be swift, brutal and surprising -- and he did all this stuff while being this intellectual thinker [and] incredible writer."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[He was also famous, eventually, for being famous.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["He looks giant on the screen [in the famous film starring Peter O'Toole] but [the real Lawrence] was 5-foot-5, with piercing blue eyes,"  Brown says. "And one of his great gifts was his ability to kind of make himself invisible. I mean, although he became one of the greatest celebrities of his era --  kind of a male Princess Diana as far as the public were concerned -- he had this incredible gift also of being able to just make himself a watcher and a listener so they didn't really see that he was there -- until he would suddenly kind of emerge from his own anonymity to dominate a room with this extraordinary gift he had for both eloquence and personal charisma."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Korda's biography includes many excerpts from Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom; he quotes vast passages, but then backs away to examine the context, ask what really happened and suggest what Lawrence may have left out.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["What I love about the Korda book is that he understands when the writer's own words, when the subject's own words, are more interesting," says Brown. She points to a passage in which Lawrence has to win the trust of King Faisal I:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"/>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[In a soft voice, speaking Arabic, Faisal asked Lawrence, "And do you like our place here in Safra?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[To which, after a pause, Lawrence replied, "Well; but it is far from Damascus."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[To quote Lawrence, his words fell "like a sword into their midst," and all those in the room held their breath for a silent moment. Then Faisal smiled, and said, "Praise be to God, there are Turks nearer us than that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"/>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[When Lawrence says it is "far from Damascus," he's basically suggesting to these desert nomads that they stir themselves and capture Damascus, one of the great Arab cities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["It's a beautiful moment, and marvelously told by Lawrence, but also wonderfully recaptured by Korda," says Brown.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA['Command Performances']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Brown's next choice reveals a slightly different brand of heroism. It's an article from The New Yorker called "Command Performances."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["This is an absolutely delicious piece by the movie critic Anthony Lane," Brown says, about the film The King's Speech -- "which is a new movie, directed by Tom Hooper, starring Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, about the relationship between the British King George VI and his speech coach Lionel Logue."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[As Lane notes, a stuttering king that most Americans today have never heard of isn't the most obvious of movie subjects, but there's something that resonates about the unlikely friendship at its heart.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["It's a wonderful dynamic," says Brown. "The shy reluctant king, and his struggle to overcome his shyness ... these two evolve this relationship which, in the end, helps to make this hesitant, shy man -- with the support of his wife, who became of course the famous Queen Mother -- [he] gets to talk to the British nation."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[The Final Days Of Elizabeth Edwards]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Finally, Brown finds heroism in a contemporary figure: Elizabeth Edwards, who died Tuesday after a six-year battle with cancer. Brown points to a Daily Beast article by writer Margaret Carlson; Brown calls it "a terrific ... tribute to her courage."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["We all have a terminal illness," Carson notes, "except those who get hit by a bus, but few have suffered more in the public eye than Elizabeth Edwards."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[The article describes how, when it was revealed that Edwards' cancer had returned, the press corps expected to hear that her husband -- then-presidential candidate John Edwards -- was dropping out of the campaign.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["Not at all," Carlson writes. "Edwards would be staying in with Elizabeth's full-throated support, saying how important it was for the country. That day she acted as if nothing had changed, in the desperate hope that nothing had."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA["We now know how much this woman was suffering," says Brown. "Not only had she got cancer, but of course her husband was carrying on this affair and was possibly the father of this child, which he would never admit but in fact kept tormenting her about. "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[For Brown, Elizabeth Edwards' heroism emerges in the way she ultimately maintained her dignity.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["I was critical of Elizabeth at the time," admits Brown, "saying, you know, she shouldn't have supported him this way. You know, she colluded, and indeed she did kind of drink the Kool-Aid and become ... tainted by his narcissism into wanting that goal as much, or more perhaps, as he did."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Despite such doubts, Brown believes Elizabeth Edwards' courage and character are worthy of note.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["I think we also have to say that she suffered such a tremendous amount. ... She did show enormous character in terms of her children at the end, trying to make something out of this desperate mess that she'd been handed. It all went wrong, and in that sense I think we really have to salute her courage at the end."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Two rival presidents claim to be in charge of Ivory Coast, in a political standoff analysts fear may reignite violence and a civil war that divided the once-prosperous and stable West African nation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The Nov. 28 runoff election was meant to heal the West African nation split in two -- north and south -- by a rebellion in 2002.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But the disputed vote has simply deepened the divide. Initial mediation attempts appear to have failed, leaving Ivory Coast with two presidents, two prime ministers, two parallel governments and a major political headache.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Parallel Presidencies]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The incumbent president for the past decade, Laurent Gbagbo, faced off in the presidential vote against opposition challenger, Alassane Ouattara, who was declared the winner by the Independent Electoral Commission on Dec. 2.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country endorsed the decision, in line with a 2007 peace deal signed by both Gbagbo and Ouattara. The head of the Electoral Commission, Yousouf Bakayoko, announced Ouattara's victory at a heavily guarded  hotel, protected by United Nations peacekeepers and tanks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[International observers said the commission's announcement of victory for Ouattara represented the will of the people of Ivory Coast during a largely free and fair vote.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The White House, the former colonial power France, the Economic Community of West African States and others endorsed and congratulated Ouattara.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But Gbagbo's camp says the electoral commission's results missed a legal deadline for publishing the outcome of the election, and the dispute went before the country's Constitutional Council.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[On Friday, the Constitutional Council reversed Ouattara's victory and proclaimed Gbagbo president. The head of the army and other security forces pledged their allegiance to Gbagbo, who controls the state media and airwaves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Gbagbo's camp defied international calls for him to concede defeat, and he was hastily sworn in at the presidential palace in downtown Abidjan on Saturday. Gbagbo warned against foreign meddling in Ivory   Coast's affairs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["These last few days, I have noted some serious cases of interference. I hope that people will control themselves, because we didn't ask for anyone to come here and run our country," Gbagbo said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[He said it was up to Ivory   Coast to organize and publish the election results and vowed he would never surrender his country's sovereignty to outsiders.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[As Gbagbo was being sworn in, Ouattara signed a rival presidential oath of office from the safety of the aging hotel on the other side of town.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[More Destabilization For Violence-Wracked Country]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[The result is a presidential tug of war that sparked some violence in once-stable and prosperous Ivory   Coast, which has substantial deposits of oil and gas and is the world's top cocoa exporter.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The country was the economic El Dorado of French-speaking West  Africa until a rebellion broke out eight years ago. After that, Ivory Coast was divided into two -- the mainly Christian south, controlled by Gbagbo, and the predominantly Muslim rebel-held north, which is Ouattara's stronghold.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[As well, there is saber-rattling from anti-Gbagbo rebels, who have long claimed they are marginalized and treated as outsiders in their own land. The rebels warned of unspecified action unless Gbagbo stepped down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[In making its decision, the Constitutional Council, headed by one of Gbagbo's allies, Paul Yao N'dre, agreed to cancel hundreds of thousands of votes in Ouattara's loyal northern constituencies, alleging vote fraud and voter intimidation by the rebels. They rebels deny the allegations.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[The U.N. envoy to Ivory Coast, Young-Jin Choi, told journalists Friday that annulling those votes did not affect the outcome of the vote.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The rebels have a groundswell of popular support in the north. Given their backing for Ouattara, the much-hoped-for reunification of Ivory Coast appears to be a distant prospect, say observers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[They add that the rebels may simply hold onto their territory and maintain their lucrative smuggling and racketeering operations, while Gbagbo continues in charge of the south, where much of Ivory Coast's cocoa and all its oil is produced.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, the African Union dispatched a mediator, former South African President Thabo Mbeki, to Abidjan to seek a settlement to the simmering crisis.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[But neither side appeared ready to compromise, and the mediation mission ended without agreement. Mbeki left Ivory Coast on Monday night, after spending two days shuttling between Gbagbo and Ouattara, and other parties involved in the elections.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Mbeki appealed to both leaders to keep the peace.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["The African Union is very, very, very keen that peace in Cote d'Ivoire should be sustained," Mbeki said. Every effort should be made to ensure this transition to democracy succeeds. Cote  d'Ivoire needs peace and Cote d'Ivoire needs democracy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[The military has reopened air, land and sea borders and eased a nighttime curfew. Gbagbo says everyone should return to work and to school. But the situation remains tense.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Fighting Is 'A Nightmare, Deja Vu']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Plumes of black smoke billowed in some neighborhoods in Abidjan on Monday, where young men manned barricades of burned tires, demanding Gbagbo's departure.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[But the leader of the pro-Gbagbo Young Patriots' Movement, Charles Ble Goude, says Ouattara has violated the constitution and Ivory Coast's laws, and he should go.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA["Our laws need to be respected. You cannot declare the results of an election in a hotel," he said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Anxious Ivorians, like Eric Agneho, want their political leaders to reconcile and an end to the presidential power struggle.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["I feel this is like a nightmare," says Agneho. "People are getting tired now. And we don't know when it's going to end. It's a nightmare ... it's like deja vu."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[Leaders from the Economic Community of West African States are holding an emergency meeting Tuesday on the crisis in Ivory  Coast in Nigeria's capital, Abuja.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Arone  Dyer had no particular reason to be smiling so much. She wasn't feeling  well. She'd lost her voice. She'd downed some organic something-or-other  cure-all right before sound check. But Dyer couldn't stop smiling as  she and bandmate Aron Sanchez converted  everybody within earshot of Buke and Gass' Tiny Desk Concert. With their heavy  homemade amps, Dyer and Sanchez are plenty loud, so their oddly catchy prog-punk anthems surely made their way  down the hall from the NPR Music offices.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[It's  Buke and Gass' homemade quality that draws you in at first. Dyer plays a  modified baritone-ukulele run through effects that squeal with delight, while Sanchez runs his guitar-bass hybrid through two amps (one for the  three low-end strings, another for the treble). The junkyard-Shellac  set-up is geeky, yes, and might strike a chord of novelty. But  ultimately, it's hard not to be sold on the songs or this performance. (In fact, you can  catch Buke and Gass on a winter tour right now.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The duo's debut album, Riposte, just recently made NPR Music's 50 Favorite Albums of 2010, and with good reason: There's unbridled creativity at play, as the speakers are joyfully  pummeled with unexpected delight -- exactly the way they are at this Tiny Desk Concert.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Ron Santo was 18 years old and a high school star in Seattle when doctors told him he was a diabetic. They said the future of which he had dreamed since he was a boy -- to play Major League Baseball -- was in doubt. Diabetes would make his blood sugar levels dip, causing him to swoon or even faint, and make his vision blurry.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Almost as an afterthought a doctor added, "If you take care of yourself, though, there's no reason why you can't live another 25 years."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["When you're 18, 25 years seems like forever," Ron Santo told me years later. "What I really heard was, 'You may not be able to play ball.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[He kept his illness secret. He didn't want major league teams to doubt his strength or skills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But by 1960, when he was 20, Ron Santo was at third base for the Chicago Cubs. They played day baseball at Wrigley Field, and there were sweltering summer afternoons when Santo could feel his strength dip, and he lost sight of baseballs in long afternoon shadows.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["It was like looking at the field through a screen door," he once said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[But on a team that was often famously futile, Ron Santo became a nine-time All-Star. The Cubs were pennant contenders in 1969, and Santo would run down the third base line that he so capably patrolled, leap into the air and click his heels when they won. Santo's dance, as his leaps became known, joined Ernie Banks' smile and Wrigley Field's ivy as images of joy: men playing a boy's game in a city garden under the El tracks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Of course the Cubs lost the pennant that year -- and every year since, come to think of it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[After leaving the field, Ron Santo became one of the Cubs' announcers. He didn't take on the voice of a retired jock or a sportswriter, but an unabashed fan, who sometimes could only moan or grunt at his team's errors and losses.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I get embarrassed sometimes when I hear what I said," he said. "But this is being a Cub fan."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Ron's diabetes grew worse. The All-Star who used to click his heels in the air had to have his legs amputated, and heart and eye surgeries. But he continued to work, laugh and stay late at the ballpark to sign any scrap of paper any kid ever held out to him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["What else am I going to do?" he asked. "Cub games are like therapy for me."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Ron Santo died Thursday, at the age of 70—quite a few years more than what doctors once gave him, and a testament to the enduring power of friends, family, and dreams, good times and teammates.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[There's one age group that's going into nursing homes at a higher rate. And it's not the elderly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Young people ages 31 to 64 now make up 14 percent of the nursing home population, an analysis of federal data from the Department of Health and Human Services by NPR's Investigative Unit found. That's up from 10 percent just 10 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The data do not show why this age group is entering nursing homes in such higher numbers, but Michelle Fridley's fight to stay out of a nursing home may provide a clue.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Ten years ago, Fridley was nine months pregnant and 23 when, driving on a rural road in upstate New York's Amish country, she came over a blind hill and swerved to miss a horse and buggy. Her car hit a tree; she was left a quadriplegic.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[At the time, Fridley was driving home to decorate for her baby shower. Her daughter, Felicia, was born nine days later. Ever since, Fridley, who is now 33, has fought to stay out of a nursing facility and continue living in her own home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Fridley and her daughter now live in their own apartment -- but only because a New York state program pays for Fridley's personal care attendants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Attendants are my arms and legs. I wouldn't be able to do anything without my attendants. They help me to get bathed in the morning. They get me dressed. They attend to my, both my, you know, urinary and bowels; my personal needs. They help me to cook. They drive me from doctors' appointments to wherever I need to go, and I like to get out," Fridley said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Since her injury, there have been three times when she almost went into a nursing home. One came earlier this year when officials in New York proposed cutting the attendant care program. After Fridley and others protested -- and she told her story to New York Gov. David Paterson -- the decision was reversed. However, more state cuts are expected next year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[According to a study by the AARP Public Policy Institute, the cost of attendant care is about a third the cost of providing care in a nursing home or institution. But there's an upfront cost to states to hire the case managers and aides, find the housing, and pay for other things that make this home-based care work. And states worry that more people -- who now depend upon family to provide the care to keep them out of nursing homes -- will start demanding this care at home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So as states face record budget gaps, the programs that help people live at home are cut.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Nancy Miller, at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, thinks that may be one reason the percentage of 31- to 64-year-olds is growing in nursing homes. Miller, an associate professor in the school's department of public policy, has been studying why young people enter nursing homes and published several reports documenting these data. She has found that it's also this same group going into nursing homes at higher rates. It's a trend she has found in almost every state over the past 10 years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["They were much more likely, relative to their older counterparts, to have a diagnosis of diabetes and renal failure," Miller said. "And then I also found that a substantial share came in with a mental health problem."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Miller says that shows states lack programs to help these people receive care at home. And when such support exists, it's hard to find.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Pat McMurry, who runs a nursing home outside Atlanta, agrees that it's the availability and funding of state programs that has caused the growth of working-age people in nursing homes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["I've been in this business for almost 50 years now," McMurry said. "And traditionally, nursing homes were the little old men or the little old ladies that either outlived their relatives or had some kind of a fall or a fracture. Now we're seeing a transition to a younger population, either for psychiatric issues, which once upon a time were addressed in psychiatric state hospitals, which a lot of those have closed. So this is really the only means available that are financially reimbursed."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Fighting 'Institutional Bias' ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Over the past 20 years, federal laws and policies have established a civil right to get long-term care at home. But NPR's investigation found that is only sporadically enforced.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[More than 60 percent of what states spend on long-term care for the elderly and disabled goes to pay for people -- like Michelle Fridley -- to live in a nursing home. The amount spent on home-based care has grown steadily, but not nearly enough to meet the need. Nationwide, there are some 400,000 people on state waiting lists for home-based care, double the number 10 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[At a protest in Washington last spring organized by ADAPT, a disability civil rights group, Fridley and her daughter, then 9 years old, participated. The group wants Congress to make it mandatory that states pay for people with disabilities -- young and old -- to live in their own homes. That means expanding state programs that pay for in-home attendants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"/>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The protesters blocked federal office buildings and ones that house groups representing state lobbyists and the private nursing home industry. On the back of Fridley's power wheelchair, a hand-lettered sign said: "I'd Rather Go To Jail, Than Die In a Nursing Home."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"/>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[She had also stuck a round sticker on her coat that said "Defending Our Freedom." That freedom is the civil right to get their long-term care at home. It was established by a 1999 Supreme Court decision in what's known as the Olmstead case. The court cited the Americans with Disabilities Act, the sweeping anti-discrimination law that is mostly thought of as something that puts wheelchair ramps on buildings and tells employers they can't discriminate in hiring decisions against the disabled.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[But the Supreme Court justices said the provisions of the ADA also make the unnecessary institutionalization of people with disabilities a form of discrimination.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Since then, federal policies have said states need to do more to meet the obligation that resulted to create more community-based care. The recent health care overhaul has several provisions to create financial incentives for states to expand these attendant-care programs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[But there is a contradiction in federal law. Policymakers call it the "institutional bias." Federal law requires states to pay for nursing homes, while community-based care is optional.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Fridley and the other members of ADAPT demanded that lawmakers pass the Community Choice Act, which would end the "institutional bias" in Medicaid and make it mandatory for states to pay for home-based care, just like it is a requirement to pay for nursing home care now.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[A pilot program was included in the recent health care overhaul, but it's voluntary for states. The larger bill has languished in Congress. One reason: The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost $5 billion a year. Some academic studies have said much of that money would be offset by the cost savings of caring for people at home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Janice Zalen, with the American Health Care Association, the largest association of long-term care providers, says that nursing homes play an important role filling a gap for people who don't have other choices or who can't easily put together in-home services.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[She also notes that who lives long-term in nursing homes is changing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[One reason is the rise in assisted living, a more homelike alternative. Residents get their own, private apartment, but there are nurses and aides to help, too. Nearly 1 million Americans reside in assisted living; more than 1.5 million live in nursing homes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Zalen says people who are less disabled -- and who can afford to pay for expensive assisted living -- are leaving nursing homes. The people who stay in nursing homes are poorer and sicker.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["If you go into assisted living, you'll often see people that used to be in nursing facilities. And what they say about the nursing-level people, they used to be in hospitals," she said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[And for people who are poorer and sicker, there's a big advantage to being in a nursing home: You don't have to pull together all kinds of services. All the care is under one roof.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA["It's automatic, it's just there," Zalen said. "You have your physician ... there. The nurses are there; the nurse aides are there; the dietitians are there. Everybody that needs to be there is there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[By federal law, people who face going into a nursing home must be told about alternatives. But in Miller's study in one state, nearly 30 percent of younger people in nursing homes said they weren't told about options. Often doctors and other health care providers just don't know what's available -- and recommend a nursing home instead.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Moving From Family Care To Independence]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[Those who don't go into a nursing home often rely on care from family members -- who provide it at no charge to the state, but at a cost that can be their health, time and stress.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[That's what happened to Michelle Fridley's mother, who cared for Michelle and Felicia for several years after the accident.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[The first time Fridley almost went into a nursing home was right after her accident. She said discharge planners at the rehab hospital waited for a moment when her mother wasn't around.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA["I was pulled into a meeting at the hospital," Fridley recalls. "And they recommended that I not put the burden on my family: 'Think of what you're doing to your mom.' And they recommended that I go in the nursing home. I said, 'Oh, if my mom hears this she's going to hit the roof.' She was working so hard so I didn't go into a nursing home."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[Fridley's mother, Pat Plyter, moved to a house that could be made wheelchair accessible. When Fridley finished her rehabilitation at the hospital, she and her daughter moved in with Plyter.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[Plyter found herself waking up at night to care for both her adult daughter and for her newborn grandchild. A state program paid for attendants, but mostly just three hours a day. Fridley's two nieces also helped.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA["When she was in her accident, I just prayed to God to give me the strength to do it," said Plyter. "It was extremely hard. I cried a lot."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[Fridley needs someone to turn her body in bed when she's in pain. So her mother stayed up all night, and then went to her job -- as a hospital nurse -- in the morning. The late hours took a toll on Plyter, mother and daughter agree. And in recent years, as Fridley needed more help, while her mother got less sleep.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[The constant caregiving created friction in the household: Plyter noted there was relief for her daughter, but not much for her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA["She would have a lady come in during the day and give her a shower, a pedicure and a manicure and put her makeup on," Plyter says. "I couldn't even do that and she'd sleep during the day and I didn't have sleep."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="48"><![CDATA["It was to the point where she wasn't even showering," says Fridley. "And it was because she really didn't have time. I was really depressed and I really hated what I was doing to my mom."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="49"><![CDATA[Fridley worried, too, that as Felicia got older, she would feel forced to take on more of the care. So a little over a year ago, Fridley made a desperate decision: It was time to go into a nursing home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="50"><![CDATA[But after discovering the Center for Disability Rights, a disability advocacy group in Rochester, she was able to move to a new apartment. The group, along with her local state senator, helped her move to a nearby county, where she could receive funding to live independently.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="51"><![CDATA[The money paid for a small apartment where she now lives with Felicia, and attendants who are there 20 hours a day. She even hired her two young nieces, who used to do a lot of the work free.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="52"><![CDATA[Fridley says this has been the difference between going into a nursing home and living what she considers a normal life. She's raising her daughter, she volunteers at Felicia's school and she's getting a degree in health care management through an online university. She works as a volunteer advocate at the disability group that helped her. And this year she was named Miss Wheelchair New York.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="53"><![CDATA["I've never been happier," Fridley says. "I have never been healthier. And I'll say that again: I've never been healthier. I've never been more excited. I'm living my life to the fullest."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="54"><![CDATA[She has also become a volunteer advocate, working at the disability center that helped her. Earlier this year, when the state of New York proposed cuts in the hours of attendant care that people like Fridley could get, she was one of a group that went to the state capitol and met with Paterson. Fridley told him her story of trying to stay out of the nursing home. The program was saved.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="55"><![CDATA[But more cuts are expected next year. So Fridley keeps up her advocacy. Because, if the cuts go through next time, Fridley fears she'll be forced to leave behind her normal life -- and give up Felicia -- joining the growing number of working age adults who are going into nursing homes.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As scientists monitor what the long-term impact of the BP oil spill will be on the Gulf of Mexico, sociologists and psychologists are working to mitigate the spill's impact on the psyche of Gulf Coast residents.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But they're finding it takes a special effort to reach some communities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In the fishing village of Bayou La Batre, Ala., crisis counselor Le Huong Carter steps onto a porch and takes her shoes off before she knocks on the front door. She's Vietnamese and works closely with the Southeast Asian refugees who have settled on this working coastline, south of Mobile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[A young woman answers the door and smiles when she sees Carter.  Phuong Khuu, also from Vietnam, is a widowed mother of two.  She used to work picking crab in the seafood processing plants that line the bayou.  But now, she says, her days are filled with cooking, cleaning up the house, and taking care of her kids.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["And waiting on BP," she says. "They pay the money."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Since June, she has been living on payments from the BP claims fund, and staying up nights thinking about the future.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["I can't sleep," Khuu says. "I worry [at] nighttime. I'm scared."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Sleeplessness is just one of the symptoms that researchers say have spiked since the BP oil spill. Several studies have found that more than a third of Gulf Coast residents report higher levels of anxiety, stress, anger and depression.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA['A Strong Hand']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[The uncertainty in the aftermath of the disaster has taken a toll on people who relied on the Gulf for their livelihood, according to Tonya Fistein, a therapist with AltaPointe Health Systems in Bayou La Batre. She says there are many unanswered questions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["When they do get back to work, is it going to be safe?" she asks. "Are they going to be able to sell their product? There is all of this if, if, if and what if?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Most of the Gulf of Mexico is back open for fishing.  But the market hasn't been there for the seafood, so the industry has yet to rebound.  For Vietnamese immigrant Phuong Khuu, finding other work is nearly impossible because of her limited English skills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["In seafood," Khuu says, "no talk, no read, no write. I just need a strong hand."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Counselor Le Huong Carter has enrolled Phuong Khuu in English classes, and is trying to help her in other ways.  Carter is part of an oil spill crisis team put in place this summer by AltaPointe Health Systems. They've set up group sessions and other programs to get people talking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But Khuu resists structured therapy as a way to deal with her anxiety. Carter says there's a real cultural barrier when it comes to mental health in the Amerasian community. "Depress[ion], anger or hurt are suppressed within the culture," Carter says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[There's no middle ground where people can explore why they're struggling emotionally in the aftermath of the oil spill.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["There is no concept," Carter says. "Either people are healthy or they are very, very, very broken down. People would say that person is 'coo-coo' ... or very crazy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Counselors have also discovered a religious reluctance from those who practice Buddhism to seek help.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["If they are experiencing difficulties, a lot of them feel this is a necessary thing to experience," says AltaPointe therapist Pam Maumenee. "And if they don't walk the path now, the next life won't be better, so they should pay this price."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Figuring out how to break through the cultural barriers has been a real challenge, Maumenee says. One way she tries is to start the conversation about physical, not behavioral, needs. Talking about problems with housing or utilities can lead to other issues going on in the family.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["Maybe anger is increasing," she says. "There may be substance abuse going on.  Domestic violence -- we've seen an increase in domestic violence."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[The crisis team is also trying to connect through trusted community resources. At the end of a dirt road in Irvington, Ala., is a brightly colored gate that leads to a Buddhist temple complex. It's part religious hall, part Cambodian community center. Seafood workers chat on the front porch about happier times when work was more abundant.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[The AltaPointe crisis team has been working with Van Suon, an activist in the Cambodian-American community here. He's been trying to help with claims and set up classes so that more immigrants can learn English and a trade other than the seafood industry.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast (and soon of the magazine Newsweek), checks in again for the recommended-reading feature Morning Edition calls Word of Mouth. This time Brown points to a book and a pair of articles about people who embodied heroism in three eras: a biography of Lawrence of Arabia, a review of The King's Speech and an admiring profile of Elizabeth Edwards.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA['Hero: The Life And Legend Of Lawrence Of Arabia']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Michael Korda's new book "is just the most gorgeous biography of Lawrence of Arabia," Brown says, citing the author's "accessible style" and his "fabulous eye for the gossip and the detail." And then, of course, there's the voice of Lawrence himself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["So it's a really juicy read -- I did love this book," Brown says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[T.E. Lawrence was a British military officer at the time of World War I. He'd go out virtually alone -- sometimes absolutely alone -- into the Arab desert, recruiting restive Bedouins to instigate a revolt against the Turks, who controlled the territory.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[What was incredible about Lawrence, says Brown, was how "he sort of understood, mastered and initiated this whole notion of counterinsurgency all those years ago. I mean, he understood how to penetrate, how to woo, how to be swift, brutal and surprising -- and he did all this stuff while being this intellectual thinker [and] incredible writer."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[He was also famous, eventually, for being famous.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["He looks giant on the screen [in the famous film starring Peter O'Toole] but [the real Lawrence] was 5-foot-5, with piercing blue eyes,"  Brown says. "And one of his great gifts was his ability to kind of make himself invisible. I mean, although he became one of the greatest celebrities of his era --  kind of a male Princess Diana as far as the public were concerned -- he had this incredible gift also of being able to just make himself a watcher and a listener so they didn't really see that he was there -- until he would suddenly kind of emerge from his own anonymity to dominate a room with this extraordinary gift he had for both eloquence and personal charisma."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Korda's biography includes many excerpts from Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom; he quotes vast passages, but then backs away to examine the context, ask what really happened and suggest what Lawrence may have left out.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["What I love about the Korda book is that he understands when the writer's own words, when the subject's own words, are more interesting," says Brown. She points to a passage in which Lawrence has to win the trust of King Faisal I:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"/>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[In a soft voice, speaking Arabic, Faisal asked Lawrence, "And do you like our place here in Safra?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[To which, after a pause, Lawrence replied, "Well; but it is far from Damascus."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[To quote Lawrence, his words fell "like a sword into their midst," and all those in the room held their breath for a silent moment. Then Faisal smiled, and said, "Praise be to God, there are Turks nearer us than that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"/>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[When Lawrence says it is "far from Damascus," he's basically suggesting to these desert nomads that they stir themselves and capture Damascus, one of the great Arab cities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["It's a beautiful moment, and marvelously told by Lawrence, but also wonderfully recaptured by Korda," says Brown.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA['Command Performances']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Brown's next choice reveals a slightly different brand of heroism. It's an article from The New Yorker called "Command Performances."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["This is an absolutely delicious piece by the movie critic Anthony Lane," Brown says, about the film The King's Speech -- "which is a new movie, directed by Tom Hooper, starring Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, about the relationship between the British King George VI and his speech coach Lionel Logue."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[As Lane notes, a stuttering king that most Americans today have never heard of isn't the most obvious of movie subjects, but there's something that resonates about the unlikely friendship at its heart.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["It's a wonderful dynamic," says Brown. "The shy reluctant king, and his struggle to overcome his shyness ... these two evolve this relationship which, in the end, helps to make this hesitant, shy man -- with the support of his wife, who became of course the famous Queen Mother -- [he] gets to talk to the British nation."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[The Final Days Of Elizabeth Edwards]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Finally, Brown finds heroism in a contemporary figure: Elizabeth Edwards, who died Tuesday after a six-year battle with cancer. Brown points to a Daily Beast article by writer Margaret Carlson; Brown calls it "a terrific ... tribute to her courage."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["We all have a terminal illness," Carson notes, "except those who get hit by a bus, but few have suffered more in the public eye than Elizabeth Edwards."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[The article describes how, when it was revealed that Edwards' cancer had returned, the press corps expected to hear that her husband -- then-presidential candidate John Edwards -- was dropping out of the campaign.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["Not at all," Carlson writes. "Edwards would be staying in with Elizabeth's full-throated support, saying how important it was for the country. That day she acted as if nothing had changed, in the desperate hope that nothing had."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA["We now know how much this woman was suffering," says Brown. "Not only had she got cancer, but of course her husband was carrying on this affair and was possibly the father of this child, which he would never admit but in fact kept tormenting her about. "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[For Brown, Elizabeth Edwards' heroism emerges in the way she ultimately maintained her dignity.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["I was critical of Elizabeth at the time," admits Brown, "saying, you know, she shouldn't have supported him this way. You know, she colluded, and indeed she did kind of drink the Kool-Aid and become ... tainted by his narcissism into wanting that goal as much, or more perhaps, as he did."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Despite such doubts, Brown believes Elizabeth Edwards' courage and character are worthy of note.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["I think we also have to say that she suffered such a tremendous amount. ... She did show enormous character in terms of her children at the end, trying to make something out of this desperate mess that she'd been handed. It all went wrong, and in that sense I think we really have to salute her courage at the end."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Two rival presidents claim to be in charge of Ivory Coast, in a political standoff analysts fear may reignite violence and a civil war that divided the once-prosperous and stable West African nation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The Nov. 28 runoff election was meant to heal the West African nation split in two -- north and south -- by a rebellion in 2002.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But the disputed vote has simply deepened the divide. Initial mediation attempts appear to have failed, leaving Ivory Coast with two presidents, two prime ministers, two parallel governments and a major political headache.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Parallel Presidencies]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The incumbent president for the past decade, Laurent Gbagbo, faced off in the presidential vote against opposition challenger, Alassane Ouattara, who was declared the winner by the Independent Electoral Commission on Dec. 2.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country endorsed the decision, in line with a 2007 peace deal signed by both Gbagbo and Ouattara. The head of the Electoral Commission, Yousouf Bakayoko, announced Ouattara's victory at a heavily guarded  hotel, protected by United Nations peacekeepers and tanks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[International observers said the commission's announcement of victory for Ouattara represented the will of the people of Ivory Coast during a largely free and fair vote.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The White House, the former colonial power France, the Economic Community of West African States and others endorsed and congratulated Ouattara.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But Gbagbo's camp says the electoral commission's results missed a legal deadline for publishing the outcome of the election, and the dispute went before the country's Constitutional Council.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[On Friday, the Constitutional Council reversed Ouattara's victory and proclaimed Gbagbo president. The head of the army and other security forces pledged their allegiance to Gbagbo, who controls the state media and airwaves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Gbagbo's camp defied international calls for him to concede defeat, and he was hastily sworn in at the presidential palace in downtown Abidjan on Saturday. Gbagbo warned against foreign meddling in Ivory   Coast's affairs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["These last few days, I have noted some serious cases of interference. I hope that people will control themselves, because we didn't ask for anyone to come here and run our country," Gbagbo said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[He said it was up to Ivory   Coast to organize and publish the election results and vowed he would never surrender his country's sovereignty to outsiders.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[As Gbagbo was being sworn in, Ouattara signed a rival presidential oath of office from the safety of the aging hotel on the other side of town.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[More Destabilization For Violence-Wracked Country]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[The result is a presidential tug of war that sparked some violence in once-stable and prosperous Ivory   Coast, which has substantial deposits of oil and gas and is the world's top cocoa exporter.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The country was the economic El Dorado of French-speaking West  Africa until a rebellion broke out eight years ago. After that, Ivory Coast was divided into two -- the mainly Christian south, controlled by Gbagbo, and the predominantly Muslim rebel-held north, which is Ouattara's stronghold.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[As well, there is saber-rattling from anti-Gbagbo rebels, who have long claimed they are marginalized and treated as outsiders in their own land. The rebels warned of unspecified action unless Gbagbo stepped down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[In making its decision, the Constitutional Council, headed by one of Gbagbo's allies, Paul Yao N'dre, agreed to cancel hundreds of thousands of votes in Ouattara's loyal northern constituencies, alleging vote fraud and voter intimidation by the rebels. They rebels deny the allegations.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[The U.N. envoy to Ivory Coast, Young-Jin Choi, told journalists Friday that annulling those votes did not affect the outcome of the vote.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The rebels have a groundswell of popular support in the north. Given their backing for Ouattara, the much-hoped-for reunification of Ivory Coast appears to be a distant prospect, say observers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[They add that the rebels may simply hold onto their territory and maintain their lucrative smuggling and racketeering operations, while Gbagbo continues in charge of the south, where much of Ivory Coast's cocoa and all its oil is produced.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, the African Union dispatched a mediator, former South African President Thabo Mbeki, to Abidjan to seek a settlement to the simmering crisis.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[But neither side appeared ready to compromise, and the mediation mission ended without agreement. Mbeki left Ivory Coast on Monday night, after spending two days shuttling between Gbagbo and Ouattara, and other parties involved in the elections.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Mbeki appealed to both leaders to keep the peace.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["The African Union is very, very, very keen that peace in Cote d'Ivoire should be sustained," Mbeki said. Every effort should be made to ensure this transition to democracy succeeds. Cote  d'Ivoire needs peace and Cote d'Ivoire needs democracy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[The military has reopened air, land and sea borders and eased a nighttime curfew. Gbagbo says everyone should return to work and to school. But the situation remains tense.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Fighting Is 'A Nightmare, Deja Vu']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Plumes of black smoke billowed in some neighborhoods in Abidjan on Monday, where young men manned barricades of burned tires, demanding Gbagbo's departure.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[But the leader of the pro-Gbagbo Young Patriots' Movement, Charles Ble Goude, says Ouattara has violated the constitution and Ivory Coast's laws, and he should go.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Anxious Ivorians, like Eric Agneho, want their political leaders to reconcile and an end to the presidential power struggle.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["I feel this is like a nightmare," says Agneho. "People are getting tired now. And we don't know when it's going to end. It's a nightmare ... it's like deja vu."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Arone  Dyer had no particular reason to be smiling so much. She wasn't feeling  well. She'd lost her voice. She'd downed some organic something-or-other  cure-all right before sound check. But Dyer couldn't stop smiling as  she and bandmate Aron Sanchez converted  everybody within earshot of Buke and Gass' Tiny Desk Concert. With their heavy  homemade amps, Dyer and Sanchez are plenty loud, so their oddly catchy prog-punk anthems surely made their way  down the hall from the NPR Music offices.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[It's  Buke and Gass' homemade quality that draws you in at first. Dyer plays a  modified baritone-ukulele run through effects that squeal with delight, while Sanchez runs his guitar-bass hybrid through two amps (one for the  three low-end strings, another for the treble). The junkyard-Shellac  set-up is geeky, yes, and might strike a chord of novelty. But  ultimately, it's hard not to be sold on the songs or this performance. (In fact, you can  catch Buke and Gass on a winter tour right now.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Ron Santo was 18 years old and a high school star in Seattle when doctors told him he was a diabetic. They said the future of which he had dreamed since he was a boy -- to play Major League Baseball -- was in doubt. Diabetes would make his blood sugar levels dip, causing him to swoon or even faint, and make his vision blurry.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Almost as an afterthought a doctor added, "If you take care of yourself, though, there's no reason why you can't live another 25 years."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["When you're 18, 25 years seems like forever," Ron Santo told me years later. "What I really heard was, 'You may not be able to play ball.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[He kept his illness secret. He didn't want major league teams to doubt his strength or skills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But by 1960, when he was 20, Ron Santo was at third base for the Chicago Cubs. They played day baseball at Wrigley Field, and there were sweltering summer afternoons when Santo could feel his strength dip, and he lost sight of baseballs in long afternoon shadows.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["It was like looking at the field through a screen door," he once said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[But on a team that was often famously futile, Ron Santo became a nine-time All-Star. The Cubs were pennant contenders in 1969, and Santo would run down the third base line that he so capably patrolled, leap into the air and click his heels when they won. Santo's dance, as his leaps became known, joined Ernie Banks' smile and Wrigley Field's ivy as images of joy: men playing a boy's game in a city garden under the El tracks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Of course the Cubs lost the pennant that year -- and every year since, come to think of it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[After leaving the field, Ron Santo became one of the Cubs' announcers. He didn't take on the voice of a retired jock or a sportswriter, but an unabashed fan, who sometimes could only moan or grunt at his team's errors and losses.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I get embarrassed sometimes when I hear what I said," he said. "But this is being a Cub fan."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Ron's diabetes grew worse. The All-Star who used to click his heels in the air had to have his legs amputated, and heart and eye surgeries. But he continued to work, laugh and stay late at the ballpark to sign any scrap of paper any kid ever held out to him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["What else am I going to do?" he asked. "Cub games are like therapy for me."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Ron Santo died Thursday, at the age of 70—quite a few years more than what doctors once gave him, and a testament to the enduring power of friends, family, and dreams, good times and teammates.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Lois Curtis shows off the drawers in her bedroom. "I got this. I got this," she says opening one drawer then closing it quickly and opening the next one. "I got a lot of stuff in here." There's a pocketbook in one. Two baby dolls and a couple of pencils for drawing in another.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Curtis, who has a quick and winning smile, is 43 now. But from the time she was 13 until she was 29, she often didn't have drawers or even her own room. She lived in state psychiatric hospitals and other institutions for people, like her, with mental illness and intellectual disabilities.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Today she lives in what's called a "host home" outside Atlanta. She shares a house -- with sparkling crystal lamps and plastic covers on white couches -- with the woman who owns it, who also supervises Curtis and makes her meals.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Curtis has surprised a lot of people who wondered how she'd ever make it once she got out of those state institutions: She has prospered. She's very social and good at making friends who are devoted to her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[She also discovered a hidden talent for art. She makes brightly colored pastels and pencil and crayon drawings. Her friends buy art supplies for her and even set up a website to sell her artwork.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Curtis shows off some of her drawings of flowers, animals and people -- some of them famous.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["This is Martin Luther King," she says. "He's a preacher." It's from a photograph of King, his arms crossed, his look serious. Curtis knows some of King's story. She thinks the man she painted might have been a president and she knows that we celebrate the civil rights leader's birthday.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Curtis, too, has made important civil rights history. She was the lead plaintiff in Olmstead v. L.C., a U.S. Supreme Court case, which established that a person with a disability has a civil right under the Americans with Disability Act to live in the most integrated setting. That is: at home, instead of a state hospital or nursing home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[An NPR investigation has found problems with federal enforcement since the ruling in 1999. Data obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its Office for Civil Rights, via a Freedom of Information Act request, showed a flurry of filings made immediately after the initial court decision. It also showed that Washington often sided with the people making the complaints. But that trend was short lived.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"/>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[These findings didn't surprise Sue Jamieson, an Atlanta Legal Aid Society attorney who brought the Olmstead case.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["Shortly after the case," she said, "we filed a lot of individual OCR complaints, and they were quite effective for an individual particularly in nursing homes. The Office for Civil Rights actually investigated and made findings, and the state would be required to serve that individual. It was very encouraging."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[The number of complaints peaked just as President George W. Bush came into office in 2000. There were 165 filed that fiscal year, according to the numbers collected by NPR.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["And then we noticed that the complaints were just basically sitting in the OCR office, and we would not hear any response at all," Jamieson said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[By 2008, the number of complaints was down 95 percent. Only seven were filed that year. Jamieson says people so rarely got a response, they stopped trying.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[This past July, on the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act, President Obama, speaking to several hundred disability leaders on the East Lawn of the White House, pledged that his administration would take a vigorous stand to enforce the civil rights protections that resulted from the Olmstead ruling, which he called "a decision that declared the involuntary institutional isolation of people with disabilities unlawful discrimination under the ADA."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[A Case Of Mistaken Diagnosis]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[At a noisy nursing home near Atlanta, Jamieson has another client, Delores Smith. Jamieson filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Civil Rights because the state was not providing proper services to the 78-year-old Smith, who was placed in the home after suffering a stroke.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["I'm in jail," Smith said. "I have committed no, no crime." She also said she does not want to die in the nursing home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Both Smith and Jamieson believe she could live in her own apartment -- if the state would help her find one and pay for aides who could help dress, bathe, cook, clean and get Smith around the house. But her doctor believes she needs something more like a small-care home, where she'd get round-the-clock supervision.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Smith filed her complaint with the Office for Civil Rights in Washington more than 10 years ago. She waited and waited. Finally, a little more than a year ago, she received a letter. The office was closing her case -- it mistakenly thought she had a mental illness or disability. As a result, Smith qualified for a different program.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[As the new civil rights director at the Department of Health and Human Services, Georgina Verdugo said she wants her office to do more and to hire more staff to take on these cases. "Unfortunately, because of the number of complaints we get and because the process was inconsistent in the past, we need to hear from people," she said. "We're happy to revisit these, and there have been times when we've reopened the investigations, because we want to make sure everyone is getting their fair day with the complaint process."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Smith's case was reopened. And the state of Georgia even approved her under a program -- started by the Bush administration -- to move people out of nursing homes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Still, that approval was more than a year ago, and there's been little progress by state officials since. The federal civil rights office is pushing Georgia harder to get Smith home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[A 'Landmark Settlement In An Olmstead Case']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[But one federal agency has recently become more aggressive. Last month the Department of Justice settled a long-running dispute with the state of Georgia. The state agreed to spend $77 million over the next two years to set up community-based care for several hundred to a few thousand people with mental illness and disabilities who now live in state institutions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["This is the most important and landmark settlement in an Olmstead case that the department has ever reached," said Thomas Perez, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Justice. He said with this agreement, Georgia will now live up to its obligation from the original Olmstead case -- that suit  Lois Curtis brought and won at the Supreme Court 11 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Among those is Elijah Reid, who lives at Georgia Regional Hospital of Atlanta, the same facility for people with psychiatric and developmental disabilities that Curtis sued to get out of in the 1990s. "I want to be living somewhere else. I would personally like to have freedom," said the soft-spoken man who has a history of mental illness, uses a wheelchair, but who has lived in small supervised-care homes until a year ago. He said he'd like to have a home again. "Home means family. Home means friends. Home means happiness. Home means joy. Home means security to me."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[But it's not just in Georgia that the Justice Department has been active. In the past year, it's filed briefs and joined lawsuits in a dozen states. And Perez says there are more to come. "This work is exploding and I can talk to you about Olmstead challenges in all 50 states. That is a fact."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Perez has made these Olmstead cases a priority for Justice's civil rights division. That's a change from the past, when the Justice Department sued states to improve conditions at state institutions, but did not push states to get people out of those institutions, which was required after the Olmstead decision. Perez has hired 15 new attorneys to focus on these cases.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[States have been reluctant to make the change. For one thing, it requires spending to find housing, in-home aides and case managers and build an infrastructure to make home-based care work. And states are facing historic budget deficits. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 46 states faced budget shortfalls this year and total state deficits will hit $140 billion in the current fiscal year. Rising Medicaid costs are one of the biggest parts of that deficit.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Since the Olmstead decision, states have steadily increased the money they spend on home-based care. But it hasn't been nearly enough to keep up with the demand. There are now 400,000 people on state waiting lists across the country. That has doubled in just the past 10 years.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Truth to tell, I have a real love/hate relationship with memoirs. Because I very much enjoy reading about people's lives (an unappreciative therapist might term my predilection voyeurism), I gravitate toward the biography and memoir section of libraries and bookstores. But despite the fact that memoirs are, by definition, self-referential and are therefore -- to one degree or another -- filled with variations of me, me, me, I don't really enjoy (and therefore tend not to read) what I call the "Children of Job," subgenre of memoir-writing. You know the type, and I don't need to name any names. Rather, what I'm looking for are engaging characters, enlightening and/or entertaining stories and good writing. Here are some of my favorites.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Blue Blood]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[By Edward Conlon; paperback, 576 pages; Riverhead Trade, list price: $17]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[If you, like me, could watch Law & Order reruns eight hours a day, or if you've ever been curious about the inner workings of police departments, you'll want to rush right out and read Edward Conlon's Blue Blood. After graduating from Harvard, Conlon came home and joined the New York City Police Department, walking a beat in some of the worse housing projects in the South Bronx. His wide-ranging book is partly a memoir of his experiences (he is now working as a detective for the NYPD); the effects -- pro and con -- of the Giuliani anti-crime years; the Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo cases; Sept. 11; and the scandals and the triumphs, both large and small, that mark the history of the NYPD. Nicely written (some of it appeared in The New Yorker as "Cop Diary" under the pseudonym Marcus Laffey) and filled with interesting characters (both cops and perps -- wait, make that suspected perps), this is both a pleasure and an education to read.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The Bill From My Father]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[By Bernard Cooper; paperback, 256 pages; Simon & Schuster, list price: $14]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[In The Bill from My Father, Bernard Cooper takes a familiar trope — a complex and unreliable parent -- and gives it a unique spin as he looks back on his stormy relationship with his father. Edward Cooper was a prominent Los Angeles divorce attorney, once seemingly invincible (at least to the author) but now sinking into dementia, whose constant philandering was hardly a secret from his sons (or presumably, his wife). Now, with his mother and all three of his older brothers dead, Cooper attempts to understand the complicated bond with this most difficult man, which means trying to come to grips with his father's strong disapproval of both his choice of career as a writer -- the elder Cooper wanted Bernard to become a lawyer, as all three of his brothers did -- and his homosexuality. As you might imagine, the father/son relationship did not noticeably improve when his father sent him a bill for nearly $2 million -- the cost of raising him. This moving account is liberally leavened with humor and never morphs into the oh-poor-me school of autobiography.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The Hare With Amber Eyes: A Family's Century Of Art And Loss]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[By Edmund de Waal; hardcover, 368 pages; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, list price: $26]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Every once in a while, I run across a book that has such wide appeal that I can easily imagine giving copies to nearly everyone on my gift list. One such book -- and my favorite work of nonfiction this year -- is  The Hare with Amber Eyes: A Family's Century of Art and Loss by Edmund de Waal. The author, a potter and curator of ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum, contemplates the history of his ancestors, a fabulously wealthy Jewish banking family, from the latish 19th century through World War II. He uses as the linchpin for his discussion a collection of 246 netsukes, miniature ornamental carvings (including one of a hare with amber eyes), which were originally collected by the first Charles Ephrussi and handed down from generation to generation. In the process the collection moved from Japan to Paris to Vienna, back to Japan, and thence to the author, in London. The Ephrussis were a cultural force both in Vienna and in Paris. You can see what was once their house on Vienna's Ringstrasse even now. Charles was a patron of many artists and writers; he was also the model for Swann in Proust's great novel, and he appears in Renoir's The Luncheon of the Boating Party (he's the man in the back, in profile, with a top hat and a reddish beard). I'm giving this book to friends and family who love history or biographies or art or visiting and/or reading about Paris or Vienna; to those who enjoy family sagas and, especially, to anyone who appreciates graceful, understated writing. And those who love books with family trees. Kudos to the publisher, FSG, for producing a book that's both a pleasure to hold and behold.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Journey Into The Whirlwind]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[By Eugenia Ginzburg; paperback, 432 pages; Mariner Books, list price: $16]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Anyone with the least interest in 20th century history shouldn't miss Eugenia Ginzburg's two memoirs, Journey Into the Whirlwind and its sequel, Within the Whirlwind. I first read them about a quarter of a century ago. I still remember how reading them knocked the breath out of me, as though I'd been run over by an out-of-control truck. I first learned, from reading them, of the true horrors of Stalin's reign of terror. As I turned the pages I was forced to consider how one can never predict how a friend or a foe, or oneself, for that matter, will behave under the most extreme circumstances. In Ginzburg's accounts, she presents both the highs and lows of human behavior, and by extension, humanity itself. Ginzburg spent 18 years caught up in the nightmare that gripped the Soviet Union during the height of Stalin's powers, when he turned on loyal Communist Party members, religious minorities and anyone else who displeased him. The picture I have in my mind is that of a paranoid Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, screaming almost randomly, "Off with his head," in a world in which nothing makes sense. Only Stalin's era was no fantasy, and the consequences of his paranoia were terribly real. The great staying power of these accounts arises partly from the stark facts of history, but mostly from Ginzburg's unadorned and unaffected writing about her situation. From her arrest (for not speaking up against a colleague who was later accused of being a Trotskyist) to her incarceration in prisons and jails and huts (unheated) in Siberia's gulag, we are with Ginzburg every step of the way. And I was struck by how often she finds consolation in the poetry she remembers.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Cakewalk: A Memoir]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[By Kate Moses; hardcover, 368 pages; The Dial Press, list price: $26]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[I am not a foodie, although some of my best friends are. Thus, there's no way I would have picked up Kate Moses' Cakewalk to read but for the photograph on the cover, which made me smile. (See, you can judge a book by its cover!) I continued reading it because Moses is a writer of salutary talents. And if I hadn't read it, I would have missed not only an affecting memoir but also some recipes that I feel sure -- if I were a baker -- I would immediately try out. If my oven even works. Luckily, those friends of mine who do bake have, in return for lending them the book, let me try samples of the ever-so-tasty results of several of Moses' recipes. Mainly focused on her life during the 1960s and '70s, her memoir is marked by parental discord and differences (her mother and father were spectacularly unsuited to one another), frequent moves, and a thorny family history. Cooking and reading were her lifelines out of the unhappy situations she found herself in. Each chapter includes a recipe, and each -- from cheesecake to linzer tort, from spiced pecan cake to chocolate truffles -- sounds more scrumptious than the one before. One bit of advice I feel compelled to give: brownies, page 209. Thanks to my friend Jeanette, I know the first version (with walnuts) is amazing.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[There are so many memoirs being published these days that the ones I read sometimes blend into one gigantic life story in my head, but there's no way I'm going to confuse Amy Krouse Rosenthal's Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life with any other memoir anytime soon. I had forgotten, until I reread it recently, what a delight it was to spend time with this self-described "ordinary" person, learning her quirks and hangups, her likes and dislikes, her everyday (and not) adventures (including the inspired way she attempted to get out of paying a parking ticket — you'll love it, trust me), all arranged, encyclopedia-style, from A ("Amy," "Anxious, Things That Make Me Anxious," "Ayn Rand") to Y ("You"), with appropriate cross-references and clever drawings to supplement the text. To get a sense of Rosenthal's writing style and humor, here's how the foreword to the book begins:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Darin Strauss' moving memoir Half a Life is painfully honest and inherently dramatic without seeming either precious or self-pitying. When the car he was driving hit and killed Celine, a high school classmate whom he knew only casually, Strauss' life was, as one might suspect, altered forever. Although he was held to be blameless in Celine's death (what insurance companies refer to as "a no-fault fatality"), Strauss found that this event — which occurred nearly 20 years ago — has now shaped almost half his life. In prose that is introspective, evocative and unaffected, Strauss shares with us his musings on life, death, blame and self-doubt. I wondered, as I read it, how I would have lived the rest of my life after the parent of someone for whose death I was, however innocently, responsible, says this to you:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA[In Stuffed: Adventures of a Restaurant Family, Patricia Volk delivers an affection-filled tribute to both family and food. In a series of vignettes, she lovingly describes her adored extended family. Each chapter, titled for a different food, from Butter Cookies to Caviar, is primarily devoted to one of her relatives. Among them are her great-grandfather, who was the first to import pastrami to New York; her grandfather, who invented the wrecking ball; her mother, forever trying to improve her daughters ("Mom made me, and now she will make me better"); her beautiful and best beloved older sister, Jo Ann; her embittered Aunt Lil, who embroidered a pillow with the phrase, "I've never forgotten a rotten thing anyone has done to me"; and her magnetic father, who taught her:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Sanrio, the Japanese company that defined cute, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Its star, Hello Kitty, and more than 400 other cartoon characters continue to be popular with adults and children.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Just ask Cici Cortes, 5, about Hello Kitty -- a Japanese bobtail cat who loves baking cookies and was a UNICEF   ambassador.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["She has bows in her hair, she wears cute clothes, and she has cute little whiskers," she says. "She doesn't have a mouth."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Hello Kitty is the most recognizable of Sanrio's marketing sensations. Since 1974, her image has adorned everything from small plastic coin purses and pencils, to toaster ovens and TVs with the sunny philosophy that small gifts create big smiles.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[But Hello Kitty is not just for young girls. Now, the company sells official Hello Kitty motor oil, Hello Kitty wine, a Hello Kitty smart car -- even what's turned out to be a Hello Kitty adult toy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["It's a little battery-operated thing," says New York Times writer Ken Belson. "It's a personal massager, and they see it as an innocent product meant for tired elbows and shoulders."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Unintentionally Creating Kitsch]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Belson, author of Hello Kitty: The Remarkable Story of Sanrio and the Billion Dollar Feline Phenomenon, says the company has lasted because of its winning formula: getting generations hooked on cute, even while unintentionally creating kitsch.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Belson says some fans have twisted kitty in many ways "because it's so pure, it's become sickly and a pendant of mass consumerism people have come to hate. That's not something the company would ever want to admit or promote, but it's something that's taken on an extra life of its own -- or nine extra lives."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[In 1960, Japanese World War II survivor Shintaro Tsuji started Sanrio, first to sell silk, then beach sandals, greeting cards and finally character merchandise.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The company hosts two theme parks and has produced films, books and video games starring Hello Kitty, Chococat, Badtz-Maru, My Melody and others.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Sanrio rakes in about $5 billion a year, thanks in part to its unique collaborations. That includes fashion designers and artists.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[And now a new generation of artists is reinterpreting Sanrio's  iconic  images.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[A Muse For Artists]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[In Los Angeles, Sanrio celebrated its anniversary with a "Kitty in Pink" retro-'80s prom party, a carnival and an art exhibition.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["Hello Kitty as well as all the Sanrio characters have been muses for the artists," says Janet Hsu, the president of Sanrio Inc.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[The exhibition features paintings, knitted artwork and a jellybean mosaic. One installation, called the Hello Kitty Fight Club, features a sculptured kitty with a black eye and broken paw. She appears to be bleeding pink from the top of her head.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["Yeah, you see little splatterings of blood," says Hsu, who says she doesn't mind the edgy version. "Our characters are very Zen-like and they're pretty much canvases for everyone to interpret, whether they're a fan, whether they're an artist."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Cartoonist and designer Paul Frank, who's best known for his character Julius the Monkey, paid homage to Sanrio's frog Keroppi in vinyl.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["It just makes you happy," Frank says of Sanrio's products. He and his wife are so enamored of the company that they have a Hello Kitty grand piano at their home. "I remember in the '70s, my mom would take my sister and I to the Sanrio store, and I remember just sniffing erasers. I love plastic smells."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Painter Gary Baseman says he appreciates that Sanrio isn't afraid of taking artistic risks. His painting of Hello Kitty and friends was part of the art show.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["A lot of my characters seem to drip and drool, so I wanted to take my own world and bring all the wonderful Sanrio characters to come in and play," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[And costume designer Jason Alpert, who has outfitted the outrageous comedy TV and film characters Ali G., Borat and Bruno, painted a mockup of a masterpiece for the anniversary.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["I've re-created The Last Supper, replacing Jesus and his disciples with my favorite Hello Kitty characters," Alpert says. "I've called it Pass the Ketchup. It just looked like more fun, and you know the whole thing is, Hello Kitty is fun."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Alpert's version of The Last Supper will be on display with other artistic Sanrio renderings at the prestigious Art Basel show in Miami this weekend.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Some experts would say Debbie Stocks ought to start looking for a new career, that the new health overhaul law makes insurance brokers like her obsolete.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But Stocks, 45, isn't about to give up her calling. As the one-time high school French teacher says, "My soul loves health insurance."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The law hits brokers on two fronts: First, it sets up online health insurance marketplaces called exchanges. Beginning in 2014, customers in the individual and small group markets will be able to compare and contrast health plans, which will be regulated by government, without the help of a broker.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Second, starting next year, insurers are required to spend at least 80 percent of their premium dollars on direct medical care. To save money, many are considering cutting or eliminating the commissions they pay brokers, which are considered an administrative expense. Some insurers have already started reducing broker fees.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The law also aims to simplify the marketplace for consumers by prohibiting insurers from charging women or people with pre-existing conditions more, and by limiting how much premiums can vary based on age and region. These changes, along with the creation of new standard benefit packages, should make it easier for customers to select the best plan they can afford.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Going The Way Of Travel Agents?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Health care economists and many of the lawmakers who wrote the new health law pointed to administrative costs -- including broker fees -- as a factor driving health insurance costs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[To their clients, brokers may seem like a free service -- insurers pay broker commissions directly, usually 6 to 8 percent of premiums the first year of the health plan and 4 percent to 6 percent in subsequent years. But the cost of those commissions gets passed to everyone who buys insurance. There are currently about 434,800 brokers in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the majority sell health insurance.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Of course they're just middlemen," says Paul Ginsburg, president of the nonprofit Center for Studying Health System Change. He compares them to travel agents in the pre-Internet era. "It used to be that you paid the same amount per ticket whether you bought directly from the airline or through a travel agent, and the airline gave the travel agent a commission."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[But as the market grew more competitive, airlines began to wage price wars, and agents were one of the first cuts. The airlines set up websites, and third-party sites like Travelocity were launched. There still are travel agents, but they're often boutique shops catering to customers willing to pay for the service.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA['If It's Not Right, It's Too Late']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Stocks argues that she offers her customers something that cannot be replicated by an online exchange. Many small businesses have complicated health needs that make buying insurance challenging, she says. Rick's Custom Frame + Gallery is one of those businesses.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[On a warm day this fall, Stocks visited the shop to discuss a few of the options she had in mind. The walls of the store were covered in sample frames of every color and texture, from simple woods to glossy fake porcelain in red and blue. When she walked in, co-owner Phyllis DeMaurizi gave her a warm hug as Rick Michaels, the store's master framer and DeMaurizi's partner, limped over to say hello.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Michaels, 54, was suffering from painful degenerative arthritis, and the cartilage in his hip had deteriorated almost completely, requiring a hip replacement. His insurance from his previous job was set to expire at the end of the year, possibly before he would be able to get surgery. Meanwhile, one of their employees was uninsured and needed coverage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Stocks offered a few suggestions, cautioning that if the shop signed up for a health plan now, Michaels' surgery would be a pending health claim that would probably push the rates up pretty significantly. One option, she said, was to start the group plan without Michaels and wait until he had his surgery before adding him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Buying insurance isn't "like buying a pair of pants," Stocks says. "You buy a pair of pants; you try them on; they don't fit; you send them back. You buy an insurance plan, when you try it on, if it's not right, it's too late." In addition, her firm, Your Benefits Partner, LLC, offers a continued service throughout the year by helping clients address health claims and billing concerns.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Political Pushback]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Brokers hope to blunt the impact of the requirement that insurers spend at least 80 percent of premium dollars on medical care, which puts pressure on insurers to cut brokers' commissions. Several states are planning to seek waivers from the requirement, and brokers hope their allies in Congress will try to change the law. Last week, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said it had created a task force to work with the Obama administration to keep brokers in business.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Janet Trautwein, executive vice president and CEO of the National Association of Health Underwriters, the main brokers' trade group, says that while she worries about their "ability to make a living" if insurers cut commissions, she is optimistic that they will continue to be paid to sell insurance both inside and outside of the exchanges.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Trautwein points to the state of Utah, which created a health insurance exchange in 2009, as a possible model. The exchange pays brokers a flat fee of $37 per month for each individual they help enroll.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Lynn Quincy, a senior policy analyst at Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, says that even after the health law takes effect, consumers will need help navigating their insurance options. The exchanges will make it easier to compare plans, she says, "but it will still be a pretty complex decision."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[She says brokers will fare particularly well beginning in 2014, when the number of insured Americans is expected to surge. Brokers who see their commissions cut may make up the difference in volume, Quincy says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Preparing For The Worst]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Buz Grossberg owns a popular barbecue joint in Richmond, Va., called Buz and Ned's Real Barbecue, and he has been Stocks' loyal customer for the past three years. Grossberg is a husky, effusive man, with white hair and a mischievous smile. His office is cluttered with piles of papers, binders and pig paraphernalia, and on one wall a sign reads, "Nobody gets in to see the wizard. Not nobody. Not no how."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Grossberg offers health insurance to the restaurant's managers, and he says Stocks was able to bring his yearly costs down 40 percent in the first year by putting the business on a high-deductible plan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[He says he considers Stocks to be part of his company's human resources department, providing services that they could not otherwise afford. Stocks "goes to bat for us" by dealing with pending health claims and billing issues with the insurance company, something he doesn't have time to do. "She knows where to go, who to talk to," Grossberg says. "She's timely, she gets it done, and we get answers."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Grossberg says he might be willing to pay part of Stocks' commission if insurance companies cut back on them. But that would depend on what kind of deal she can get him. "I hope as a businessman that difference would be reflected in the price I'm charged in my policy," he says, "and it would be a wash."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[With that kind of uncertainty in the market, some brokers say they are already preparing for the worst. Stocks knows several who have already sold their businesses in anticipation of the health law's effects.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[She is confident that many of her clients would be willing to pay her commissions directly, but just in case, she's buying a nearby property and casualty insurance company as a backup business.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Even if broker commissions are cut significantly and the exchanges become very popular, Stocks is hopeful that there will still be a future in insurance. "Look, I started as a French teacher, and I sell health insurance," she says. "I'll find that opportunity, and I'll go there."  [Copyright 2011 Kaiser Health News]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[These are hard times in the hard-working town of Bayou La Batre,  Ala. It's known as the state's seafood capital -- and it struggled to get back in business after Hurricane Karina.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But once again, the processing plants and shrimp boats lining the bayou are mostly idle after the BP oil spill.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[So when Feed the Children trucks recently arrived at the community center, the turnout was huge. About a dozen volunteers worked quickly handing out big cartons packed with food and household goods. Residents had to sign up in advance, so some were reluctantly turned away.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["We're out. We only had 800 cards and 800 boxes of groceries," a volunteer gently tells those without tickets for the day's goods. "I'm sorry, we just don't have any more."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[No one makes a scene. This is not a place where asking for help comes easily.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["It almost makes you not even want to walk up and ask," says Lena Hofer, 25. "Because of how many times I've had to do this, it's really hard when they send you away after you do, especially when you need it like I do. I'm about to cry. It's hard."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The red circles around Hofer's blue eyes and frail frame are evidence of the toll from the spill.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["I'm a homemaker," she laughs, as if she no longer believes it. "My husband was a shrimper. It's bad. It's put us in a really bad spot."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["We are very, very close on the edge of losing everything," says Aaron Hofer, Lena's husband, holding back tears. "But, you know, God feeds the birds. How much more does he love us? I have to tell myself that, like, 100 times a day."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Lost Everything But Their Children]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Aaron and Lena Hofer have been on a downward spiral since the spring. And they are not alone. Now, seven months after BP's oil well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, researchers say more than one-third of coastal residents are experiencing symptoms of trauma.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Aaron, 27, is a fourth-generation shrimper who lost the lucrative summer season to the BP oil spill. Now the shop where he worked part time picking crab for cash has closed down. The Hofers can no longer pay the rent, have signed up for food stamps, and are bouncing from home to home, staying with relatives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["It's taken a toll on us. We've split up twice since this happened," Lena says. "We're just now starting to talk and get back together. Because we've lost our place to live, we have lost our vehicle, we have lost our phones."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[They've lost everything but their children.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["They make me happier than anybody," she says. "Whenever I'm down about everything that's going on, I just look at them and know that I'll be all right as long as they're still in my life."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["They constantly ask, 'Why we got to stay with Aunt Mimmy? Why do we have to stay with G-granny? Why do we have to stay with Maw Maw? Are we going to Billy's house?' You know. 'I want to go home,' is what they want," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Lena has noticed behavioral changes in her kids.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["They stress out," she says. Her 2-year-old has started biting his fingernails. "And he holds his ears whenever just the stress of life come up. Because he don't even want to hear it, you know, and he's 2. He understands too much."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Children are little sponges -- they pick up on everything that happens to their parents, says Shelley Foreman, coordinator of children's services at the Gulf Coast Mental Health Center in Gulfport, Miss.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[She says more than one-third of the 80 families they treat report oil-spill related trauma symptoms in their kids, such as anger, irritability or acting out at school.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["They can't use their words because they may not be able to identify what they're feeling, so the only way they know how to tell is by their behaviors," Foreman says. She says the spill has had a spiraling, trickle-down effect that disrupts the functioning of families.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Aaron Hofer is an Iraq war veteran. He's in constant motion as he speaks -- cracking his knuckles, munching on peanuts or smoking a cigarette. His wife says she hardly recognizes the "dog-faced soldier" who never used to let anything get him down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["He's taking this harder than he took Iraq -- and he was at death's door every day over there," she says.

        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[And there's still no closure, he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[Barrilleaux and other psychologists believe they're only seeing a fraction of Gulf Coast residents suffering from trauma symptoms, in part because in many coastal working towns, there's a stigma associated with seeking help of any kind -- and particularly for mental health care.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA["Part of the spirit of being a commercial fisherman has to do with independent thinking, being your own boss, being in control of yourself," Barrilleaux says. "These people are the last true hunter and gatherers on earth, when you think about it.  They have a sense of -- I wouldn't say invincibility -- but a sense of self-reliance: 'No matter what, we can handle it.'

      <text>
        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The voice of Luther Vandross has been called "flawless" and "as smooth as silk." It's been  known to create an atmosphere of pure romance: For many years, Vandross was  the go-to singer for when you wanted to get in the mood.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[More about the bedroom in a moment. First: that voice. Vandross' vocal instrument was supremely fine-tuned, controlled and yet effortless. That breezy quality was something Vandross perfected during the years he spent as a background vocalist for some of the biggest stars of the 1970s: Bette Midler, David Bowie and Barbra Streisand are just a few of the A-listers who wanted to work with him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Vandross first met bass player Marcus Miller when they were both in Roberta Flack's band. Miller says Vandross was a "connoisseur of background singers." Like Vandross, Miller was one of the most in-demand session musicians at the time, so he and Vandross were always bumping into each other. Miller says he was 17 or 18 when they first met.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["I was a hard-core musician, mostly jazz, so I didn't really respect singers that much," says Miller. "They were just somebody in the front of the band entertaining the audience while we were doing the real work in the back."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But Vandross changed Miller's mind. Miller says that during downtime on the road together, Vandross would "educate" him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["He would play me Aretha Franklin. He'd play me Donny Hathaway. All the great singers," Miller says. "And he would explain to me exactly what they were doing. Most singers can't do that because, although they're very talented, they're not really technically knowledgeable about what they're doing."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[But Miller says Vandross was.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["He'd say, 'OK, now listen to Dionne [Warwick],' " Miller says of Vandross. " 'She's going to hold back the vibrato. She's going to add it right now, for drama.' And I was like, 'Whoa, this is like playing an instrument. This is pretty incredible.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Miller says it was then that he became a fan of singing -- and a fan of Luther Vandross.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[When Vandross went solo, Miller wanted in on the action. They worked together for more than 20 years, co-writing songs and co-producing albums together. Before long, some of the singers Vandross idolized growing up became fans of his -- including Warwick, who describes Vandross' voice as a piece of velvet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["It was smooth to the touch, easy to feel, wonderful to look at," Warwick says. "When I heard Luther's voice, I heard peace. It made me feel good."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Bedroom Music]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[And what sort of mood could Vandross put you in? Stephanie Williams says she needs to censor herself to answer that question.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["I'll just say baby-making mood," says Williams, music director for the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Miller picks songs that will appeal to the radio show's older audience. Williams says it's a funny thing with Vandross: Even though he could make just about anybody think about things to do in the bedroom, she says he was not the object of desire.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["It wasn't a sex-symbol thing with Luther, even though his music was extremely sexy," Williams says. "He could get us in the mood to be with this other guy, and we loved that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[If you want to see just how much women adored Luther Vandross, take a look at the video of the NAACP Image Awards from 1988, when Vandross sang "A House Is Not a Home" to an ecstatic audience. Anita Baker is almost giddy. A young Janet Jackson has a huge smile on her face. And Dionne Warwick, who originally made the song famous, is beaming as Vandross sings what she calls "the definitive version."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Marcus Miller says he saw firsthand how Vandross didn't need any masculine swagger to make women swoon.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["He did it with just the opposite," Miller says. "He did it with sensitivity, just being honest and being open with your emotions -- that's what really gets to women. I'll tell you, he got more underwear thrown at him than a little bit."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Please, No More Underwear]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Vandross apparently never liked having underwear thrown at him onstage, nor did he favor the nickname "King of the Bedroom." Miller says Vandross believed he sang about something deeper: "Two people connected on that special level," Miller says. "I think that was the ultimate to him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[But Miller says Vandross never really found it himself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["I didn't meet anybody who was steady with him. It would work out for a while, but ... I don't know," Miller says. "I think that's what made his songs so intense. He was looking for that. The one thing he wanted so much and sang about so well is the one thing that he really didn't get himself."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Luther Vandross died on July 1, 2005.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[On a DVD special called Always and Forever, the man who started his career as the backup singer and arranger everybody wanted in his band was thrilled to say he'd come into his own.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["One thing I really love about my career," Vandross said, "is that when I came out, I wasn't hailed as 'the new Otis Redding' or 'the new Sam Cooke.' I wasn't 'the new Teddy Pendergrass or Smokey Robinson.' I wasn't the new anybody. I was Luther."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Dionne Warwick says "many have tried" to be the new Luther, but in her mind, no one has come close.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Writer and explorer Dan Buettner has spent his life traveling the world in search of answers. His early life consisted of trekking throughout the world on a bicycle, covering thousands of miles in Africa, Asia, South America and beyond. His travels around the world (and on assignment for National Geographic) inspired him to discover and name the globe's "blue zones," the countries and societies with the longest life expectancy, the greatest happiness and other strengths. His first book to come out of this research was 2008's The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, a prescription for life extension that became an international best-seller.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Now, Buettner is back with a new book, Thrive, which focuses on happiness in the "blue zones," and how everyone can attain a better quality of life by following the happiest countries' examples. Buettner spoke with Weekend Edition Sunday host Liane Hansen about his studies and how we can all infuse more joy into our lives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA['A Place Where A Garbage Man Makes As Much As A Lawyer']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"/>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Buettner devotes a section of Thrive to Denmark, where the "gross national happiness" is incredibly high. When asked why this is, he notes that the country's leveling tax structure enables its citizens to have more freedom. "Normally when we think of happiness, we think of money and status, but Denmark teaches us the opposite lesson," he says. "There, you have a place where you are taxed to the mean. A cultural norm reminds everybody that they are no better than everybody else, so you're not going to choose your career path based on status. You're in a place where a garbage man makes as much as a lawyer. So what you have are 4 million people who excel at things like furniture design and architecture."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Buettner also notes that in Denmark, most people only work "37 hours a week on average, and they take their full six weeks of vacation," noting that a liberal work schedule leads to greater happiness overall.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[He also traveled to Singapore for the book, finding that the citizens there responded well to the stringent law enforcement. "What you have here is a place that's very secure. Evolutionarily speaking, we are more hard-wired for security than freedom," he says. "So in Singapore, while you can't buy pornography, a woman can walk any street day or night and be completely secure that she's not going to be raped or mugged. And there's also tax laws in place that encourages people to stay closer to their aging parents. That way the elderly are taken care of and happier, and it turns out the way socialization works, we get more satisfaction retroactively socializing with our parents than anybody else."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA['The Happiest People In America Socialize Seven Hours A Day']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"/>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[In terms of translating the lessons from the "blue zones" to daily life, Buettner recommends that people "set up permanent nudges and defaults" in order to maximize happiness.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["For example, in our financial lives, we know that financial security has a three-times greater impact on our happiness than just income alone," he says. "So setting up automatic savings plans, and buying insurance as opposed to buying a new thing. The newness effect of a new thing wears off in nine months to a year, but financial security can last a lifetime."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Buettner argues that relationships are really the key to lifelong happiness, noting that "the happiest people in America socialize about seven hours a day," and mentioning that "you're three times more likely to be happy if you are married ... and each new friend will boost your happiness about 10 percent."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[He also states how important good relationships can be in the workplace, adding that "the biggest determinant of whether or not you'll like your job is if you have a best friend there, more so than how much you're paid, so proactively make sure you have good friends there. One way I assert doing that is: Be the one who organizes happy hour."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA['The Luster Of Experience Can Actually Go Up With Time']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"/>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Finally, Buettner says that he has learned that people are happiest when they spend their time and money on experiences, as opposed to objects. He advises taking up an interest in sports or the arts, which will provide longer-term satisfaction than any one purchase. "The luster of an experience can actually go up with time," he says. "So learning to play a new instrument, learning a new language -- those sorts of things will pay dividends for years or decades to come."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[When asked about his own happiness level, Buettner admitted that he is incredibly content. After all, he has spent his life in the hot pursuit of adventure and helping others discover how to live longer and smile more. "I have always followed exactly what interests me and never really worried about the money," he says. "And when you think about it, to be able to travel the world ... on an expense account and do exactly what interests you, it just doesn't get much better than that."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[His name was Alvin Thomas. But nobody dared call him that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[During a life spent gambling -- and mostly winning -- he earned the nickname "Titanic Thompson" -- because Titanic could sink anybody.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Titanic Thompson became one of the most famous gamblers of the 20th century. Poker, golf, billiards, target shooting -- you name it, Thompson bet on it. And with a little creative cheating, he usually won.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The tall tales of Thompson's life are now collected in a new biography by Kevin Cook called Titanic Thompson: The Man Who Bet on Everything.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[According to the book, Thompson "had close-set eyes that looked a little dead. At least, until he offered you a bet.  Then those dark eyes sparked, and he smiled like he had good news. 'Are you a gambling man?' he'd ask. 'Because I am.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Thompson even once scammed Al Capone out of $500, Cook tells NPR's Audie Cornish. The pair were leaving a poker game, and they passed by a fruit vendor. "I can throw this lemon all the way on top of that building across the street," Titanic boasted. Capone took the bet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[What the infamous gangster didn't know was that Thompson had prepared the bet the night before -- by filling a lemon with buckshot to make it easier to throw.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The gambler's reputation even inspired hard-boiled crime writer Damon Runyon to write Thompson into the story that became the musical Guys and Dolls -- as the character Sky Masterson.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Not bad for "a boy who came out of the Ozarks with nothing." Cook says Thompson was self-taught, living by wit and guile. "He was proud of that," Cook says. "He wanted to prove he was deserving."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Though he made millions over his lifetime, Thompson died almost penniless in 1974. Despite the glamorous tales, he lived a lonely life, moving from town to town looking for new suckers. Through five marriages and a scattering of offspring, Thompson really never connected with any person -- only with the games.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Eight years ago, Shannon Lynch Siegler, now a mother of three in New Jersey, invited her somewhat estranged brother to move in with her family. She didn't see him often, but she wanted him to help care for her newborn son.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["I can't imagine how life would be today for either of us if we had not re-found each other through my son," Siegler wrote in response to an NPR query. We were looking for a family that was struggling in difficult economic times, but one where siblings were helping each other make it through.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The brother, Chris Lynch, now works at a cell phone store in a mall in Woodbridge, N.J. But eight years ago, Lynch had dropped out of college and was living with his mom in a small, upstate New York town where, at least according to him and his sister, there wasn't much of anything going on. He saw his sister, Shannon, maybe once or twice a year. She and her husband were about to have a baby.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Although Shannon was working for an insurance company and her husband was an employment lawyer, child care seemed unaffordable.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[I didn't "want to leave my newborn with a stranger," Shannon says. "I was working in [New York City] and my husband was working in Hackensack, [N.J.]."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[As for Chris, he was feeling frustrated.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["I was pretty much directionless," he says. "I had done some college, but I didn't really feel the need to do more, especially living in that area, nobody went to college. People just did a lot of blue collar jobs, and I knew I didn't want to be that, but I didn't know what I wanted to be."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[So his sister Shannon and her husband, Steve, decided to invite Chris to move to New Jersey, to take care of their son. Chris was really a big kid himself. But would he be responsible?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["I wasn't exactly sure how he was going to react to it," Shannon says, "and at this point, I didn't know him that well any more. He was my brother, and I saw him on occasion, but I wasn't close, close with him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[As for Chris, his first thought was, "Oh, crap. Nanny? Really? I didn't think I was good with kids. I have no idea how to change diapers. I don't want to touch what comes out of there," he laughs. "But then I kept thinking about it. This is really kind of a way out of what I am doing right now, and it gave me kind of hope to do something else."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Helping Each Other, Becoming Best Friends]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Chris and Shannon describe their family background as bleak. Their father was an alcoholic; their mother was depressed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["Although I don't think we would have identified that as kids," says Shannon. "We just knew that in some ways they weren't reliable."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Shannon was attempting to rescue her brother from continuing in a sad cycle. Chris felt alone, emotionally abandoned, and he wanted more but didn't know what.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[As it turned out, Chris was meant to be a dad. "It was one of the first few things I really loved staying with," he says. "As I did it, it became easier; it became a really joyful job, one of the most rewarding jobs I ever had."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Now more than money or status, Chris says he wants to be the "dad I didn't have" for his own kids. His sister says, "I can't imagine what his life would have been like if he had stayed [where he was]; we would not have this relationship."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Today, the two consider themselves best friends, as well as brother and sister.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA['Some Kind Of Achievement']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"/>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Charlie, the kid Chris moved down to take care of, is now 8. On a Friday night, he is practicing the cello, while his younger brother and sister are drawing. Pizza is in the oven. And Shannon, her husband and the boys are all getting into their uniforms for Cub Scouts. The parents are Cub Scout leaders.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Life isn't easy. Shannon and her husband, Steve, are having economic difficulties. The people Steve defends in employment discrimination cases often can't pay their bills. The family is going through debt consolidation. Their entire pension is tied up in their home, which has lost a lot of value in this economy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[At the same time, Chris is going through a divorce; he has a 5-month-old, a new family, and four kids in all. His ex-wife is going through bankruptcy, and there's lots of debt.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Yet Shannon smiles when she thinks of how her brother has changed, and that she might have played a small part.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["If you're truly a friend and you're truly someone who loves another person," Shannon says, "you want them to be able to be what they can be. Maybe not every single thing they can be, but that they can get some kind of achievement that will make them feel proud of themselves and their life, and you want to see that for them."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[When you look at these two families, you notice something else. Besides trying to give their kids the best life possible, these people still have their own dreams. Besides repairing cell phones and taking care of his kids, Chris is writing a suspense novel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[When asked what her dreams are for her brother, Shannon says, "I would like to see him be the author he wants to be."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Blake Mycoskie travels a lot. He's an evangelist in service to his mission: To provide children, mostly in Third World countries, with a new pair of shoes that will allow them to move safely and securely through their daily lives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Mycoskie's shoe company, Toms, is the darling of college students and hipsters, people who love efficient design and philanthropic businessmen. He speaks several times a week about how and why he started the company, and he chuckles that it never fails: "People always come up and look around and say, 'Um, where's Tom?' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But Tom is a concept, not a person. It stands for shoes for tomorrow, because as the 34-year-old Texas native recalls, "We said for every pair of our shoes that's purchased today, we'll give away a pair tomorrow. It's the tomorrow's shoes project."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[It was a great idea with one hitch: "Tomorrow's shoes" was never going to fit on the tag on the canvas slip-on that is recognized as the Toms shoe. So the name was shortened to Toms. Mycoskie shares the story frequently, and he always ends with this: "I like to say we're all Tom, the people here and everywhere else that makes this happen. We're all Tom."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The Chief Shoe Giver]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Mycoskie works out of a big, windowless warehouse on the outskirts of Santa Monica, Calif., that houses most of the company staff. The foyer is decorated with snapshots of trips to donate shoes -- the company calls them "shoe drops" -- in places like Argentina, Ethiopia, South Africa and Latin America. Smiling children's faces brighten the dim space. Inside, bare plywood and boxes of irregular shoes block off spaces for individual cubicles. A big sculpture made of discarded shoes forms the word "give" on a cement wall. Mycoskie, who likes to refer to himself as Chief Shoe Giver, sits square in the middle of everything: No corner office, no door. He's surrounded by just a few pictures of family and friends, who happen to include businessman philanthropist Ted Turner and Bill Clinton.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Clinton calls Mycoskie "the most interesting young entrepreneur I've ever met. He is not your conventional business guy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[True enough. He certainly doesn't look like your typical businessman: He looks like a guy who spends a lot of time surfing the globe. And he has a deep tan and lots of amulets and charms around his wrists and neck to prove it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[An Entrepreneur At Heart]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Mycoskie became an entrepreneur at age 19, when he and two friends started a student laundry service while they were all at Southern Methodist University. The business soon became popular on surrounding campuses and got so big, he dropped out of school and later went on to found four other companies. He took a break in 2002 to take part in the second season of the CBS reality series The Amazing Race. He and his partner -- his sister Paige -- ended up a respectable third, and they both vowed to return to Argentina one day, because they didn't really see anything, Mycoskie says -- they just ran through on the way to the next challenge.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[His chance came a few years later when, exhausted from the long hours he'd spent running an online driver's education company, he took off to Argentina for a month.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["I learned to play polo, took tango lessons, and I got to travel through the country and really see it," Mycoskie recalls.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[He ended up in a remote indigenous village near the Brazilian border and noticed that most of the children there had no shoes. Not only were they cutting and bruising their feet when they walked long distances to fetch water for their households, many were home from school because they're not allowed to attend barefoot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["In one family, there was one pair of shoes," he recalled, "so the children shared them back and forth, and whoever had shoes went to school that day."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[That's where the idea for Toms was born. Mycoskie got a local supplier to make an adaptation of the alpargata -- the rope-soled cloth slip-on that many Argentines, rich and poor, wear. He sold them with the promise that for every pair bought, another pair would be donated, thereby making the customer a philanthropist.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I wanted to create a business model that would sustain the giving," Mycoskie says. "Initially, I just wanted to give 250 pairs of shoes." But it worked so well, Toms celebrated the donation of 1 million pairs in October.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA['They Want To Give, They Want To Help']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[The company that started with Mycoskie and a couple of interns now has a staff of just over 100. They began out of Mycoskie's Venice, Calif., living room -- the space was stuffed with shoe samples, buzzing phones and myriad interns sitting cross-legged on the floor while working on their laptops. Liza de la Torre was one of them, and she says in the beginning, she intended to work for the summer to get cash for graduate school.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["But it was so interesting," she remembers. "I mean, I'd worked before, in nice, downtown offices with beautiful desks and views of the city -- but this was different. It was exciting. It was young people running a company. So I decided to stay a little longer." Five years later, she's one of the key members of Toms.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I don't think I realized how huge this is," de la Torre admits. "This is really changing the way people spend money, because they want to give, they want to help."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[The company has helped children on the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. It's aiming to eradicate a disfiguring disease in Ethiopia that occurs when bare feet absorb silica from the soil, resulting in grossly enlarged feet and legs. It's trying to get well-fed, well-shod Americans to go barefoot one day of the year (this year it was in April) to emphasize how hard it can be to do even mundane tasks in unprotected feet. And it's hoping to change the world, one pair of shoes at a time.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[At 34, Mycoskie is still very much the eligible bachelor.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["I love what I do, but it is hard to have a personal relationship when you're never home," he says. He's planning to cut down on his travel next year, and maybe rectify that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[But it's going to be a rare person who can compete with his other passion. "You know, you hear people talk about soul mates? That one person that you see, and that's it for you? Well, Toms is the business equivalent of a soul mate for me. It combines all the things I love to do most — travel, hands-on helping and creative entrepreneurism. So I think I'm going to be doing this for a long, long time."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Egyptian authorities are sensitive about anyone talking to Bedouins near the Israeli border, as I discovered during a reporting trip for Part IV of our series on Egypt airing on Morning Edition this week.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[We sought out the Bedouins, tribal desert-dwellers, for a story on the rights of minorities and women in Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak has been vocal about promoting national unity and supporting the rights of women and ethnic and religious minorities. But the government has done little to enforce those rights.And some Egyptian authorities were clearly nervous that we were seeking out the views of Bedouins.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Part of it is that officials are quick to blame these nomadic people whenever there's malfeasance on the Sinai Peninsula. In fairness, some Sinai Bedouins are -- by their own admission -- involved in smuggling across the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The other reason for the uneasiness of officials is a desire not to get the Bedouins riled. They are not shy about making their displeasure known, sometimes violently.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Members of the Le family were excited, and nervous. They were moments away from being reunited -- after 35 years -- with sailors and officers from the USS Kirk. They'd always wanted to thank the ship's crew for its kindness when they were refugees fleeing South Vietnam.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[This past summer, the Le family heard an NPR story about the Kirk, a small escort destroyer. The Kirk's crew spoke about how they'd been haunted by the death of an infant they'd tried to save. That child was their son, Bao Le.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The Le family now knew how to contact the crew that had helped them. There were telephone calls and e-mails and then a chance to meet face to face.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[So in late October, the family and the crew gathered in Pensacola, Fla. The parents, Loan and Pierre Le, and their children -- daughters Kimsa Hoang, Kimmy Le, and Kim Penridge and her husband, Andrew, and the youngest of the Le children, son Alex -- flew in from Texas. Members of the Kirk's crew had come from around the country for a showing at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola of a new documentary about the Kirk's Vietnam mission.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Remembering Bao ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Before the two groups reunited, the Le family sat down with NPR to talk about their story. Pierre Le unfolded a pink piece of paper. It is his son's death certificate, issued by the U.S. Navy. The cause of death: "cardiopulmonary arrest" due to "gastroenteritis" and "pneumonia." At the bottom it gives the precise location where Bao Le's body was buried at sea. Not the South China Sea, off the coast of the Philippines, but: "At 14 degrees, 34 minutes North Latitude and 119 degrees and 26 Minutes E Longitude."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Loan Le had also brought a photo of Bao Le, the only photo that exists. "I was very proud of him because as you look in the picture, he was very handsome," she said. The photo, in browns and whites, is about the size of an index card. And the boy in the white shirt is in mid-movement, as if he's ready to jump into someone's arms. There's an impish smile forming on his lips.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Just weeks after that photo was taken, Saigon fell. It was the spring of 1975. The Le family, desperate to get out, squeezed onto a South Vietnamese ship.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The NPR series told the forgotten tale of the Kirk, which had started one of the greatest humanitarian missions in the history of the American military. In the spring of 1975, as Saigon fell and the Vietnam War ended, the USS Kirk was chosen to go back to Vietnam, by itself, on a mission to rescue the remnants of the South Vietnamese Navy, to prevent those ships from falling into the possession of the North Vietnamese.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Those 30 South Vietnamese ships, trailed by scores of fishing boats, were packed with more than 20,000 refugees, including the Le family, desperate to leave Vietnam.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The Kirk started the rescue and was then joined by other Navy ships. The flotilla escorted the South Vietnamese ships to the Philippines.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[During the crossing people soon became sick in the cramped ships. Stephen Burwinkel, the Kirk's medic -- in the Navy he's called a hospital corpsman -- went from ship to ship attending to those with dysentery, dehydration, diarrhea and other illnesses.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Bao Le had gotten violently sick with cramps and fever, so Loan Le and her infant were moved from a South Vietnamese ship to the Kirk. The captain gave up his stateroom to the mother and son. At first Burwinkel was able to revive Bao Le, giving the child a massive dose of penicillin.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[But the boy's fever returned. "I have a very bad feeling that he, he wouldn't survive," said Loan Le. She recalled holding him, massaging him, telling the boy she loved him and praying for him. "I pray, I say, 'Please, God help him. He's my only son.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But on May 6, the boy died. He would be one of only three people to die during the weeklong evacuation. Bao Le was also the youngest. The ship's logs said he was 9 days old. But that was wrong. He was 1 year and 9 days old.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Loan Le recalled her desperation when the Kirk's crew told her what she most feared, that her son had died. "I was hysterical. And I say, 'Let me see my husband and my children, first. Because I don't want to be here by myself. I want to tell them, I have to tell them,' " recalled Le, wiping away her tears.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Chief Engineer Hugh Doyle was sent over to the Vietnamese ship to get the father and the three Le daughters and bring them to the Kirk. He was moved to find that the Les' three children were about the same ages as his own back home in the U.S. Daughter Kimsa, the oldest, was 7; the next, Kimmy, was 5, and Kim was 4. Doyle recorded cassette tapes and sent them home to his wife. In one he described telling the father his son had died.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["He asked me does his wife know. So I told him, I said, 'Yes, your wife knows. She knows and she's very sad.' And all the way back in the boat, he was saying, he says, 'When we left Saigon we were six,' there were six people in his family. And he kept shaking his head and he said, 'And now we are five. It is very sad, very sad.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Pierre Le has vivid memories of the respectful funeral the sailors held for his son on the fantail of the USS Kirk.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I remember that was at night. A chilly night, even as it's in summertime. And I still remember there's a moon, too. And I see that there are many soldiers in a line up there. I don't know if I can call it a coffin or not. But, you know, it's the body of my son was wrapped under two flags: the Vietnamese flag and the American flag."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Pierre Le recalls that someone played taps. His son's body was on a board and, as the board tipped, the body slid into the dark South China Sea.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[For middle daughter Kimmy, her brother’s burial at sea is her first memory -- stamped and stark in her mind.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["I'm sure my parents told us that my brother died," she says. "But I don't think I grasped that. And I remember the funeral. And I remember when he went over. I remember running towards the edge of the boat. And I remember standing there looking down. And I remember [thinking]: 'How come no one is going to get him?' " she recalls.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[She remembers, too, how one of the sailors scooped her up and took her to another part of the ship and gave her candy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[A few days later the flotilla of ships arrived in the Philippines and the Le family was taken to a refugee camp in Guam. The Kirk's crew would visit the Le family, bringing food and candy and once, even a projector and showed the film The Towering Inferno. Later, the Les resettled in Hawaii. Pierre resumed his career as an architect and now runs a family financial service firm. The family moved to Texas. Another child, Alex, was born.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[A Thank You After 35 Years]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Bao Le's death at sea was something the family would barely talk about. The children saw how sad it made their parents when they raised the subject or asked questions. But the children grew up knowing the family hoped one day to thank the crew of the Kirk.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[And now, in a Pensacola restaurant, they do just that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[As the family walks into the restaurant the sailors of the Kirk come over to greet them. There are hugs and tears. Hugh Doyle introduces himself to Kimmy and then to her father. Pierre.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["Hi. I'm Hugh. I think I met you when you were a little tiny girl. Do you remember getting onto the boat?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Pierre is finally able to say the words he has been holding on to for 35 years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["Thank you very much for helping my family. For taking care of, good care of my family."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Then he spots Capt. Paul Jacobs and breaks into a smile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA["Let me say hi to the captain. I remember his face. You're the captain. See I cannot forget you."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[Jacobs clearly remembers Le and gives him a hearty handshake.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["I can't forget you, either. That was a long, long time ago."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[They linger for hours over lunch. The crew members from the Kirk talk about how they'd come home from war, about their careers and family since. The Le family talks about how they became Americans, about their careers and family since.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[And they talk about the tragic death that brought them together long ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[When they finally leave the restaurant it is almost time for a reception and showing of the film at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. Jan Herman, a historian with the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, has put together the documentary to tell the story of the Kirk's humanitarian mission. For the Le family it is a chance to see and hear the larger story of the journey from South Vietnam to the Philippines.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[But just as the film is about to begin, the retired Capt. Jacobs calls Loan and Pierre Le to the front of the theater. They are clearly surprised as they make their way down to where Jacobs stands at a podium. They hold hands as he speaks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA[Jacobs says the crew decided to make a proclamation about their son Bao Le and put it on a plaque to honor his death on the USS Kirk.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[Jacobs pauses with emotion as he reads the words on the plaque. "Bao Le is now and forever more an honorary crew member of the good ship USS Kirk. Though on board for just a tragically short time, Bao Le's impact on the entire crew of Kirk was profound. ...]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA["He fought a good fight, struggling in vain to defeat pneumonia. And when he left us during that arduous sea journey to freedom, he left behind hundreds of his shipmates who were deeply saddened and heartbroken by his death.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA["Many years have slipped by since that epic time yet Bao Le's Kirk shipmates still remember him for his valiant struggle to live. But also as a symbol of the struggle of the tens of thousands of his Vietnamese countrymen who accompanied him on that journey to freedom on the South China Sea."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[The family is touched by the plaque and its words. They each speak of how the day's events had closed the circle for them, even perhaps making it easier in the future to talk about Bao Le.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[For Kimmy Le, who was the 5-year-old watching a funeral she did not understand, the day has given her the chance to do something she had been thinking about since high school.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA["I guess the yearning of finding them was to let them know that what they did made a difference. And I wanted them to see where we are now, you see, how happy we are here living in the U.S. And I wanted to say thank you and I wanted them to see we all grew up. And here we are."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Abraham Reiss was  born at the end of the 19th century near the city of Lviv in modern-day Ukraine.  The details of his life are  sketchy, and it'll become clear why in a moment. But from the little I know, he  lived in a village then called Stanislav.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Abraham owned a small brick factory. He and his wife, Esther, had three children. The youngest was Aryeh.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[By the time he became a young man, Aryeh left the village to settle in Palestine.  He had witnessed too much hatred and saw what was coming for the Jews of Europe.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[For the next four years, he urged his mom and dad, brother Reuben and sister Bronka to join him. But they decided to stay.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Now I wish I could fill in some more details here, but I can't.  All I know is that in 1945, Aryeh Reiss received a letter in the mail. Everyone was gone. Killed by the Nazis.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Aryeh was my grandfather, Abraham and Esther my great-grandparents.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[For Aryeh's generation of Jews -- those who escaped -- the stories were similar.  Aryeh's wife, Clara, my grandmother, last saw her parents, Menashe and Adela, in the early 1930s.  She never found out the name of the concentration camp where they were killed, never had a chance to touch their ashes or visit a mass burial site where their anonymous bodies were tossed with hundreds of others.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[I have never seen a photograph of Abraham or Esther or Menashe or Adela. I don't know if my son's blond hair and infectious smile come from any of them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The details of their lives were wiped out.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[What I do know is that they were killed by people motivated by the most extreme and hateful ideology mankind witnessed in the 20th century.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[I tell this story because this past week, some of my colleagues here at NPR were called that name. Nazis.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The president of Fox News, Roger Ailes, made those remarks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[I remember when I was sent to Berlin to take up my first foreign posting as an overseas correspondent more than a decade ago. I was at a party with young Germans, and I thought it might make them feel more comfortable if I made a joke describing a hotel clerk I'd run into as a "Nazi."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[No one laughed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[And it was the first time I realized that that word -- Nazi -- means something very real to the millions of Germans who have courageously struggled to come to terms with that legacy for 65 years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[It also means something to the estimated quarter-million Holocaust survivors still alive today with numbers tattooed on their arms.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Nazism was unequivocal. It was depravity. It was bodies buried one on top of the other. It was deliberate, mechanized killing. It was a movement that seized the minds of a segment of humanity.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Just 65 years ago, within the lifetime of many people still alive today, the Nazis killed 1 out of every 3 Jews on the face of the Earth. They destroyed a world and a way of life for millions of people -- Jews, Christians and nonbelievers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[That word, Nazi, means something. We are all free to use it as we please. It's our right, of course. But when its use is stripped of any of its real meaning, I just ask you to remember the story of Abraham Reiss.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[So how's a lowly banana going to compete for attention?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Some stores are getting wise to shoppers' desires to eat better, as well as the challenges they face in doing so. Some are subtly shifting the focus to healthier products by using the same marketing tricks the large food companies and restaurants have used for years. The bonus for them is that they can sell more and waste less.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Brian Wansink, the co-director of the Cornell  Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs, says grocery store sales goals are compatible with public health goals. "Grocery stores want you to buy healthy things. They want you to buy produce, because if produce goes bad, they lose money," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But just putting more produce and healthy food choices in the aisles is not going to cut it, he says. "Even when you give people these incredibly healthy stores, they're not buying escarole and tofu -- no, they're buying what they want. It's not escarole and tofu simply because it's in front of them," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Wansink is also the author of Mindless Eating, a book about why we eat what we eat, and the subtle cues that make that happen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[He's done a lot of research on produce and found that there are small things stores can do that will help them move a lot more volume of the healthy stuff.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Take product placement and soft, focused lighting, for example. Items that are highlighted in this way -- even if they aren't on sale -- sell about 30 percent more, Wansink says. They just look more appealing than products under harsh, overhead fluorescent lights.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Leading Customers To Good Nutrition ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[One company that's taken some of this kind of advice to heart is Wegmans, a regional grocery store chain located primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[And it seems to work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Like many people, Terri Williams of Bladensburg, Md., struggles with eating better. She wants to incorporate more fruits and vegetables in her diet, for one thing. But it's a challenge, she says. Her daughters are grown and out of the house, and she doesn't cook much for herself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[But when she walks into the brand new Wegmans in Lanham, Md., for the first time, she gets excited.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The produce section is front and center. Williams' eyes light up when she spies some of her favorite vegetables, lit by a soft spotlight, and right by the entrance.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"/>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["We're going to get some candy yams," she says excitedly, and starts piling several into her shopping cart and talking about how she'll roast them later.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[And that's exactly the kind of enthusiasm Krystal Register wants to hear. She's a registered dietician and a staff nutritionist at Wegmans. It's her job to help customers and employees make healthier food choices.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["We actually have lightened the ceiling in this new store, and we're using some natural light with some high windows, and yes, we direct the lighting right on the product," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Register shows off the new store to a visitor: Near the produce, a trained vegetable adviser prepares some of the featured items for customers to taste. She hands out advice and recipes with a smile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I love that the vegetables are right there, before you get to the processed food," says Gretchen Muir of Upper Marlboro, Md., who was shopping with her husband, Kenny, on a recent weekday.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Muir also thinks the store's varied offerings improve the neighborhood's food choices. "There's too much fast food in this area," she adds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Around the corner from produce, there's the smell of prepared foods being cooked and served. Smells can be used as an enticer, rather than just "fanning them out of the building," as many stores do, says David Glenn, a doctoral student at the University  of Connecticut. Glenn spent 20 years in food marketing before returning to school and is working on ways to improve kids' diets using marketing like this.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[And then there's the Wegmans bakery, where rows of whole grain breads sit side by side with white bread -- they're not relegated to the back corner somewhere.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[The frozen pizza is placed right next to the frozen vegetables at the end of another aisle, and that's by design, says Register.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["Our mission ... is to help our customers with good nutrition in the aisles, and on the plate," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Aside from lighting, it's important to put healthy products at eye level, Wansink says. "What you're doing is encouraging people to take stuff that's right in front of their eyes," he says. That way, they don't have to work, looking up and down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Signs Matter]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Also, take a hint from a good restaurant menu. Describe the foods you want to highlight a little, he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[For example, if you describe something as "succulent Italian seafood filet" rather than just "seafood filet," it will sell 27 percent more, according to Wansink's research for Mindless Eating.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[And then there's the concept of anchoring. That's when stores offer a deal on a set amount of items. It makes people buy more than they ordinarily would, because that limited-amount number sticks in their brains, he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Wansink admits that even well-educated consumers fall for marketing. Shortly after he published research on anchoring, he found himself with a friend in the checkout aisle, where he saw a special on gum.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[He says he saw a sign advertising eight packs for $1, and started counting them out on the conveyor belt. His friend pointed out that he had just done studies on the topic, and, he says, he started putting the gum back.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Don't Overdo It]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[The danger with these marketing tools is in going overboard, bombarding people with public health messages about how they should eat better. If people feel persuaded, they will resist, Wansink says. Stores have got to make the shoppers feel like it's their choice.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"/>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["It's like when you're at a stoplight and the light turns green and the person behind you honks all of a sudden, what do you do? You pull away a little slower," he says. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[A new museum exhibit in Berlin focuses on the mass appeal of a failed artist who spent time in a homeless shelter and went on to become one of history's biggest mass murderers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The exhibit, "Hitler and the Germans: Nation and Crime," is drawing huge crowds at the German  Historical Museum.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The show explores how ordinary Germans not only accepted but often also celebrated and idolized the Fuhrer. It also shows how the Nazi's racist ideology seeped deeply into popular culture and everyday life with playing cards with Hitler on them, Nazi board games, Third Reich quilts and swastika party lanterns all on display.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["I think it's really important to show it again and again and again over the next decades," says 38-year-old Markus Hoppe, who came from Hamburg, Germany, to see the exhibit. "There were so many who were involved [in Nazi crimes]. ... The media and people -- they were involved."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Historical Propaganda]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[It is not the first time a German museum has exposed the depth of the Fuhrer cult. But it is a first for the German Historical  Museum -- the country's national museum.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The cultural artifacts are striking. There is a large stand-up ad for drummer cigarettes with a smiling brown-shirted Nazi SA member. Hitler is a drummer for big ideas, the saying went, smoke national socialist cigarettes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[There are metal signs that were posted in public parks and at entrances to towns: "No Jews wanted," they exclaim.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The Luftwaffe- and Wehrmacht-themed board games, which suggest family fun playing blitzkrieg around the kitchen table, caught the eye of Hoppe.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I was really impressed in a negative way by those sick games they played during the war, like war games," he says. "I can't believe this. I haven't known this before."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[It wasn't just board games that targeted children. There are hand puppets for kids from the early 1930s with grotesque caricatures of Jews and other groups the Nazis would later murder en masse at death camps and elsewhere.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[There are carefully colored toy figures made of plastic, a new material at the time, so kids could play with goose-stepping Wehrmacht soldiers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[And they could create their own Nazi rally with a toy Hitler giving his stiff-armed salute from a podium surrounded by swastikas and Gen. Hermann Goering, the Nazi military and party official who committed suicide after he was sentenced to death for war crimes and crimes against humanity at Nuremberg.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[A Broad Regime]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Historian Simone Erpel, one of the curators of "Hitler and the Germans," says the exhibit is important to underscore again that the crimes of the Nazis were not committed by only a few.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["Not only one man, not only the SS, not only some perpetrators, but the whole society [took] part to stabilize this regime and make it possible," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Erpel stands before a large needle and patchwork tapestry, which was created by village women from a Protestant Church in central Germany.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[The tapestry, which was started in 1933 just after Hitler took power, shows boys and girls in Nazi garb. The church congregation and the army are all marching toward the church, surrounded by the words to the Lord's Prayer. A swastika flies from the church steeple above the cross. The tapestry's meaning is clear: Party, church and state are one.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["The motive is, 'We bring the swastika into the church,'" Erpel says and notes that the congregation was ordinary and adapted quickly and eagerly to the Nazi ideology.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["There was not a political reason to do it," she says. "They do it for themselves."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Erpel also says the show comes at an opportune time given the increasingly shrill tone of anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[A Notable Absence]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[But the idea of a larger circle of guilt has been explored before, and some German critics complain the exhibit fails to break new ground.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Indeed, a fear of Hitler the man seems to hang over the show. There are no speeches by the Fuhrer played out loud -- just a snippet on the audio guide. There is a piece of a table from Hitler's ridiculously oversized Berlin office; you were meant to feel small in front of the Fuhrer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[But after much debate, the curators decided not to include any of Hitler's personal items, like one his many uniforms, out of concern that such things might become objects of veneration by some or that they could be seen as glorifying the genocidal dictator.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["Maybe some of the visitors would interpret it as 'Hitler returns,'" Erpel says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Other museums in Germany explore the Fuhrer cult as part of their permanent exhibits. They include the Topography of Terror museum in Berlin, the Berghof museum in the Bavarian Alps and the House of the Wannsee Conference, a memorial and museum in the waterfront mansion in suburban Berlin where, in January 1942, Nazi officials met for lunch and mapped out the bureaucratic mechanics of the "final solution" genocide campaign against European Jewry.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[One wonders why a deeper exploration of the Fuhrer cult is not part of the Berlin museum's permanent collection.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[A Better Understanding]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Despite its flaws, many Germans who have visited the exhibit say it is eye-opening and important to have in the capital.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA["We didn't learn a lot about the Hitler cult in school in the '70s," says Sabine Hornisher, who came from Stuttgart, Germany. "Of course we saw a lot about concentration camps, about who won and who lost and the political situation. But I think people were still a little bit afraid to talk about the Hitler worship [back then], and this is why I find this important now."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[When you see all these pictures here today maybe you cannot fully understand it. But at least you come one step closer, she says.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Miller is the  Giants' local radio play-by-play man and a life-long fan of the team, but he also moonlights for  ESPN Radio's national broadcast of the World Series.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["It was kind of nerve-wracking," he tells NPR's Neal Conan. "[I was] very mindful that there were a lot of Texas Ranger fans tuned in to that game, and a lot of fans who weren't really following either ball club."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Miller says the job is the same for the local play-by-play guy and the national one: "Try to describe accurately what's going on, try to be on top of everything, to give a good visual image of the action on the radio."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But if he'd been doing the local broadcast, he says he would have called the game only slightly differently and maybe wouldn't have been so mindful of Yankee, Red Sox and White Sox fans.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Let's face it, when [Edgar] Renteria hit the home run, it was a tremendously exciting moment for Giants fans, and I got excited about it," he says.  But he believes, had it gone the opposite way, he would have been "equally as excited" about that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Baseball's exciting one way or the other. Even if it's a local broadcast, for me it's always about the game itself, and how interesting, exciting, and just how much fun it is," Miller says.

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The Kinect, out in stores Thursday, attaches to the Xbox 360 video game console and lets you play games using only your arms, legs and body. But, the technology is about more than fun and games.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[I tried Kinect and it definitely got me off the couch. A game called 20,000 Leaks had me underwater in a virtual glass tank contorting my body to plug leaks. As I moved my body, my avatar followed along.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["What it does is it takes the controller that you normally hold in your hands out of the picture entirely," says Microsoft's Shannon Loftis, who was part of the team that developed Kinect.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[When the lights come up for Wednesday night's World Series opener in San Francisco, they'll be focused squarely on two teams more accustomed to the shadows.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Before tonight, the Texas Rangers had never made it to baseball's biggest event. The hometown Giants made it in 2002, but they haven't won it since 1954 -- when they were the New York Giants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The Rangers toured AT&T Park in San Francisco on Tuesday, looking up and gawking like a bunch of tourists as they walked around the ball field. First baseman Jorge Cantu stood and watched, mesmerized, as a groundskeeper sprayed bursts of blue paint onto a World Series logo.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["You know what? I wasn't like admiring the painting or anything. I was just thinking to myself, like, 'wow we are really here,'" Cantu said during the media day event.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[For some, it was their first trip to AT&T; for many, it was their first trip as players to a stadium decked with World Series bunting. And for hundreds of reporters, it was a chance for a crash course on all things Rangers and Giants.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Rangers batting coach Clint Hurdle talked about how lots of elements came together to make this season so successful for Texas. One of those factors was the addition of veteran slugger Vladimir Guerrero.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Almost anybody I've talked to in the media is surprised at the year he's had based on what they saw last year," Hurdle said. "Well, that's good for Vlad."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Signing pitching marvel Cliff Lee didn't hurt things for Texas, either. Manager Ron Washington said that when general manager Jon Daniels told him that lee was coming to the Rangers, "my reaction was, 'Good job, John. You're the man!'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[In the postseason, Lee is the man. He's gone undefeated in the playoffs for his entire career. He's a lock -- a sure "W" -- and one of the reasons why Texas, along with its powerful lineup of hitters, is favored as the series gets under way.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[That's music to San Francisco right fielder Cody Ross' ears]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[In the "getting to know the Giants" part of media day, Ross attracted lots of attention. He was the closest thing to a breakout star the team had during the playoffs, and when he's not flashing his ever-ready smile, he's bashing home runs -- two in a single game off previously invincible Roy Halladay in the National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[But it's not power that drove the Giants, it's pitching. Veteran first baseman Aubrey Huff said that, with all due respect to Lee and Halladay, people better not forget about their staff.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["That Philly series, everybody was talking about their big three," Huff said. "Well, hell man, we got [a] big four. You know, I think you just get that East Coast bias. Nobody really sees the West Coast; everybody's already asleep by then. We've got some tremendous pitchers."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The country may not be sold on this season, but putting hard-throwing closer Brian Wilson in front of the microphones will help. His bushy black beard has spawned a "fear the beard" mania in San   Francisco.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Wilson told reporters Tuesday that the whole beard thing came about when he "went on a road trip, forgot a razor, came home, cleaned up the neck and just missed the rest of the face." After that, he said, "it took on a life of its own."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[If there is such a thing as scaling Mount Everest in fiction, it's writing a novel that gives us individual lives in their fullness while also capturing how these lives fit into the flow of history.  Where most Americans see themselves primarily as free, self-defining individuals, in many other countries, that's almost impossible -- history is constantly rubbing up against you.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Nowhere is that truer than in the Holy Land. I was reminded of this as I read To the End of the Land, the latest novel by David Grossman, the brilliant Israeli writer and activist whom some call "the conscience of his country," an honorific I sure don't envy him. I have enough trouble being the conscience of myself without having to do the job for millions of other people.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[That said, To the End of the Land is a novel that, among many other things, is about conscience. Its heroine is Ora, a gray-haired mother of two, recently separated from her husband. When her beloved son Ofer goes off on a military operation, Ora is terrified for his life. But rather than wait for the so-called "notifiers" to show up at her door with horrible news, she leaves Jerusalem. This is at once a form of magical thinking -- if she's not there to get the bad news, then Ofer won't be hurt -- and a way of refusing to be part of the war-making process. And so Ora hikes for days in the hills of Galilee along with her former lover, Avram, from whom she's been estranged for decades.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[As the two climb between terebinth trees and placards devoted to those killed in Israel's wars, Ora tells her life story. We learn all about her and husband Ilan, their two sons, Ofer and Adam, and the family life they built. Along the way, we also learn what happened during the Yom Kippur War that turned Avram, once a spritely source of exuberant artistry, into a quiet man who has retreated from the world.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Grossman began working on this book when his son Uri was in the army, and he hoped that writing it would somehow protect him.  It didn't. Uri and his tank mates were killed by a rocket in Southern  Lebanon. Naturally, this gives To the End of the Land a moving resonance, but Grossman would be the first to say that this doesn't guarantee its literary merit or give it any special moral authority on questions of war and peace. If the book was only about Ora fearing for her son, it would be just another boringly well-meaning anti-war novel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[In fact, it's much, much more.  For starters, Ora's story is about living in a country defined by what's known simply as "the situation," the daily pressure of Middle Eastern history with its hatred and pettiness and killing. The book's original Hebrew title is "A Woman Flees News," and the point is that Israelis can't really flee it and remain Israelis. And this exacts all sorts of costs on everyone -- Jews and Arabs alike. Ora isn't simply worried that Ofer will be killed but that, in the ugly process of fighting the nation's battles, he will turn into someone she can't approve of, a hypermasculine thug. She wants him -- and Israel -- to have a clear conscience.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Then again, if To the End of the Land were only about the soul of Israel, it would feel abstract and emotionally hollow. Instead, it's enormously powerful.  Grossman has a feel for the fury and mire of domestic life, for the thrilling sound of the individual human voice. I've read few novels that capture so well the adventure of raising kids -- Grossman has always been drawn to the magic of childhood -- or the way that men's bantering conversation can close out women, even a mother who loves them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[At the center of all of this stands the unforgettable figure of Ora, a woman at once nurturing and exhausting, sensual and deeply moral, boundlessly garrulous and not a little secretive, a life force and a real piece of work. As both a devoted mother of two sons and a loyal daughter of Israel, she yearns to be free of the moral and physical threats that are the very air she must breathe, but like Grossman, she knows there's no escape from history, let alone what lies beneath it -- the terrible fragility of families and nations and life itself.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Iraq hasn't had a full census since 1987, and shortly before it was due to launch one this fall, the government postponed it until December.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Besides providing baseline data for all kinds of urgently needed programs, the census is one part of a plan to ease Kurdish-Arab tensions in the northern part of the country, where the mixed-population city of Kirkuk has become a flash point for the country's ethnic, religious and sectarian divisions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In a poor, mostly Arab neighborhood of Kirkuk, a slender, elderly man who gives his name as Abu Adel sells potato chips and soft drinks in a reed-covered lean-to fronting a mud shack. He's embarrassed by his family's tiny, dirty home, but his biggest fear is that the plainclothed men who have been harassing him -- he suspects they're Kurdish security men -- will return and force them to leave.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["About three weeks ago, they came and questioned me," he says. "They said, 'Where are your papers? Where are you from? Why are you living here?' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Abu Adel says he would leave if the government would give him the roughly $15,000 it promised to help him relocate. He says one of his sons got the payment and returned to their native Nassariya in the south. But without the cash, he can't afford to follow.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[An Ancient, Polyglot City -- With Oil]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Kirkuk has thrived along the banks of the Khasa  River for a long time. It's one of several places that claim to be the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Assyrians, Kurds, Turkmen and Arabs all have historical ties to Kirkuk, but over the centuries the demographics have been dramatically -- and sometimes brutally -- transformed, both before and after large quantities of oil were discovered in 1927.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein's forces uprooted thousands of Kurdish families and leveled their villages. Arab families were moved up to Kirkuk from the south, often lured, like Abu Adel's family, by promises of jobs and inexpensive housing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[After Saddam was toppled in 2003, the fate of Kirkuk became a sensitive issue. A three-step mechanism was devised. First, the "Arabization" of Kirkuk would be reversed, then a census would measure the relative sizes of the various communities, and finally a referendum would determine whether Kirkuk residents want to be part of the Kurdish-controlled north.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Allegations Of Fraud]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Mahmoud Mohammed Majid, a Kurdish member of the provincial council, says waiting until December for the census is one thing, but he worries that those behind the delay are actually seeking to block it altogether.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["You know," he says, "we have no problem with the Turkmen here. The problem is the Arabs -- those who still follow this Saddam policy of Arabizing the Kurdish areas."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[At the headquarters of the Asaish, the Kurdish security force in Kirkuk, spokesman Farhat Mohammed Ali denies that his men are harassing Arabs and pressuring them to leave. But he says too many of them are taking the relocation money under false pretenses.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["According to the law, once they get the money they have one month to leave," Ali says. "But many of them take the money and move to another neighborhood in Kirkuk, and bribe the local mayor to let them stay there illegally."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Fear Of Kurdish Domination]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[But Kirkuk's Arabs and Turkmen say past injustices against the Kurds, real as they may have been, are only part of the story. Najat Hussein Hassan, a Turkman member of the provincial council, says since the fall of the old regime, the Kurds have been busy repopulating Kirkuk -- with staggering success.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["It's true that Saddam displaced thousands of Kurds," he says. "But after the fall of the regime, the number of Kurds who were brought in here, it's something like 500,000. This number is huge; it's illogical."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Kurds dispute that figure. But Nermeen al-Mufti, a spokeswoman for the Iraqi Turkmen Front, says if the government tries to force the census on Kirkuk now, it will trigger resistance well beyond Kirkuk.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["The first thing is, Turkmen and Arabs, not only in Kirkuk -- in Kirkuk, Diyala, Salahudeen, Mosul and Anbar -- they are going to boycott it," she insists.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[The Burden Of Diversity]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Majid, the Kurdish council member, smiles wearily at the heightened tensions that have greeted this latest attempt to unravel the Kirkukian Knot. He says his city is proud of its diverse heritage, and he believes most people would be happy just to get along. But that, it seems, is not Kirkuk's fate, he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["This kind of cultural and ethnic diversity -- in a place like America it's a blessing, a source of richness. But here it's a curse," he says. "It's the same with the oil. For some it's a blessing, but here in Kirkuk it's a curse."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[For now, Iraq's first full census since 1987 is set for early December. But some Iraqis wonder if they will someday be seen as following in the footsteps of Lebanon, where political and religious divisions have prevented a national headcount since 1932.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Bruno Mars is the man of the moment, and a man who wants to be timeless. His debut album, Doo-Wops and Hooligans, has yielded a No. 1 hit single, "Just the Way You Are," and he's co-produced hits for artists ranging from Cee-Lo Green to Travie McCoy. He's appeared on Saturday Night Live and already undergone his first career scandal -- a September arrest for alleged illegal-drug possession. For all this, he still sounds like some kind of angel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Mars sings with the sort of serene assurance that both excites and puts you at ease. It's the voice of a young pro, an entertainer fully in command of his phrasing. It's hard to resist the clever come-on refrain of "Grenade" -- "I'd catch a grenade for ya." What girl could resist such a promise, especially when it comes swirled inside such a creamy melody? Mars is one of the most potent examples of the current movement to restore rhythm-and-blues crooning to a prominent place within hip-hop beats. He also creates songs that break free of any sort of easy category, such as the urgent pop-rock-soul of "Runaway Baby."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[When he appeared on Saturday Night Live recently, Mars sported a blue dinner jacket and a pompadour that made him like the leader of Little Anthony and the Imperials. Given Mars' obvious knowledge of the whole history of American R&B, I wouldn't be surprised if that reference was intentional. After all, in addition to impersonating Elvis in his little-kid, family-band days, he's also imitated Frankie Lymon and Michael Jackson. One song here, "Marry You," can be heard as Mars' salute to '60s girl-group pop.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Mars has created a number of hit singles for other artists as a part of the Smeezingtons, a production team consisting of Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine. One of the benefactors of his talent, Cee-Lo Green, returns the favor by singing with Mars in "The Other Side," a surging ballad that sounds like a space-age anthem. Not for nothing did the man born Peter Hernandez adopt the last name "Mars."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[With his sweet smile and aggressive talent, Mars is no shy flower. He's positioning himself to become a new prince of pop -- maybe even a king. Doo-Wops and Hooligans is such an impressive, varied and intense experience, it makes you wonder whether he can sustain it. These are the some of the most pleasurable worries you can have about a new star; they're worries that, if they've even occurred to Bruno Mars, have been dismissed as he gets on with the work of creating more pleasure.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In 1983, the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome was 25. Today, it's 60. A documentary airing Oct. 14 on HBO tells the story of two adults with Down syndrome who get married. Monica & David is about their courtship and their married life together. But the documentary is also about what it's like to be a parent of someone with an intellectual disability.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Monica's mother, Marie Elena Walters, is indomitable.  When Monica was a toddler, Walters' husband walked out.  Realizing Monica may never be self-sufficient, Walters set out to get a high-paying job so she could take care of her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["I firmly believe my life's work is Monica," says Walters in the film.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But Walters also admits that she -- and other parents of children with disabilities -- can be overprotective to a fault.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Because we want to protect them so much," says Walters, "we are typically the first ones who treat them poorly by subconsciously denying them their rights to have a normal life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The documentary, by filmmaker Ali Codina, begins the night before Monica and David's wedding. It's obvious they're crazy about each other.  David calls Monica his "Winnie the Pooh."  When David calls her on the phone, Monica rushes to answer it, saying, "My baby! He's worried about me."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Even so, Codina says, some people in Monica and David's circle treated their wedding like it was just a "cute gesture between kids."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Codina, who's Monica's first cousin, saw something very different.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["To me the wedding was something very powerful, very serious and very adult," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[About 200 people attended the wedding. But the absences were telling. Codina says the parents of some of Monica and David's friends -- friends who also have intellectual disabilities -- did not let their adult children attend because "they thought it would fill their sons and daughters' heads with ideas."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Monica and David are very positive people who are eager to please.  But Codina says that growing up, she often felt there was more going on "beneath the surface." Codina was hoping her film would stir it up.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Monica and David wish to be independent -- and in the film, their mothers' struggle with this becomes palpable. They grapple with just how much independence their adult children can handle.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[In many ways, Monica and David seem like any conventional married couple. They do chores around the house together. Monica fusses when her husband takes too long to fold the laundry. But the documentary also hints at their limits. While Codina was filming, the family moved from a house to an apartment -- a change that, as the movie shows, completely unsettles Monica. Bewildered, she stands in her now-empty bedroom, wondering where everything went.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Betty Anne Waters’ older brother Kenny was convicted of murdering a neighbor and sentenced to life without parole.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But Waters was convinced that her brother was innocent.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[She worked for 18 years to clear his name, a struggle that led her to get her college degree and then a law degree. And now her story is being told by two-time Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Swank stars in the new film, "Conviction." NPR’s Michel Martin recently spoke with Waters and Swank about the film and the importance of bringing such stories to the big screen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Swank on fears of being typecast into roles that portray “real people”:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[… This is the reason why I'm an actor. I believe this is why I am on earth, is to help get stories told like Betty Anne Waters and Kenny's story. This is the kind of original, compelling stories that you don't find so much in fiction. So when I'm, you know, old and grey, if people say you know, wow, you got stereotyped playing those types of roles, I will have a smile from ear to ear.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Waters on being assured of her brother’s innocence of murder charges early in the case: ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Kenny could be very sweet at any given time, and other times he can't control his anger. So if he was confronted by something he wouldn't know how to handle a situation and he would overreact and get angry. But he's not an aggressor, so he would not be the type to break into someone's home and murder them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[On how she decided to lead the fight for his freedom: ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[My brother, after he lost his appeals, which took a few years, after his conviction, he called me on the phone after I hadn't heard from him in about a month, and that was because he was in segregation for a month, because he tried to commit suicide. And I was angry at him for trying to do that, but at the same time, in the same conversation, he said Betty Anne, I can't live here for the rest of my life for something I didn't do. I'm not going to make it. And in that same conversation he said, but if you go back to school, go to law school and become my lawyer, I can do it. And I said, I have a problem, though and he says what? I said have a GED.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Swank on why it took nine years to make Conviction: ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[I think right now people want to see feel-good stories. It's just the nature of the business. You know, the only thing that I can compare it to is Million Dollar Baby, because we almost didn't get that made. And that's a movie that made over $300 million. So it's just the stigma with studios about dramas. I hear audiences all the time saying I want to see drama, I just want to make sure it's good drama. And, you know, this is a movie I am very, very proud of…]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Swank on the larger issue of wrongful incarceration:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[I think [the film] will absolutely shine a bright light on a big flaw in our justice system. … As a human species, we're quick to judge. And when someone is found guilty we instantly think, oh, yeah, they must have done it, because the powers that be and the courts that know what they're doing said they were [guilty]. And, you know, as we sit here right now, there are innocent people in prison. And I absolutely think that any time you can have a movie … like Betty Anne sharing her story, and any time you can talk about it, it just sheds more light on something that needs to be looked at closer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Waters on what she hopes Conviction will accomplish:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[First of all, I hope it draws attention to other people… Like myself, I always thought people that were in prison were guilty, until this happened to me. … And now I know that I'm not alone. There are a lot of people in prison that are innocent. … I keep thinking that one day, I'm going to hear that somebody saw this movie and they either did something -- or didn't do something -- and another person was freed because of it. And I can't wait to hear that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Waters on her brother Kenny’s sudden death, just months after being exonerated and freed:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[He had an accidental fall and it was unbelievable, again. My brother had very bad luck. … And it was awful, but the one good thing about that was, as I had to tell Hilary during the filming (she was filming [to portray] the day that he was released, and she came over to me actually in tears, crying, saying how could that happen?), there's always the good side to a bad side. I can't find the good side. … The good side is my brother died free. And he died with his family and friends and he died an innocent man, people knew he was innocent, and that is the upside of that.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[NPR's Louisa Lim has just returned from Pyongyang, where she was one of a small group of foreign correspondents to cover the debut of heir apparent Kim Jong Un. In an unprecedented move, she wasn't monitored for part of the trip and was able to walk the streets, eat in local restaurants and interact with ordinary people without government handlers. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The morning light over Pyongyang is gray, as people scurry along the streets to work. Even in the center of the capital, there is almost no early morning traffic. Music is piped through the streets from loudspeakers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[This is the soundtrack to people's lives; a repertoire of about 20 rousing state-approved songs looping ad infinitum. It's yet another reminder of the state's control over everything, including the very sounds its subjects hear.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[It's long been known life is unimaginably tough in North Korea. And last December, the state tried to push through currency reforms, which made it even worse.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[People aren't starving, but most are constantly hungry. For almost two months after the currency re-denomination, the markets shut down, the restaurants shut down. There was simply no food available to buy, even in Pyongyang, home to the trusted and politically reliable elite. The currency reform was meant to reassert political control over the new merchant class. It failed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Since then, the markets are back up and running, but prices have roughly doubled. A simple meal for two -- rice, a plate of kimchi and pork, and two bottles of beer -- costs 3 euros (or about $4).  That may not sound like much. But at best guess, it's roughly three days' wages. And at black market rates, it would take an ordinary person a month to make enough local currency to change for 3 euros.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[I say at best guess, but the truth is nobody knows. North Korea is an information black hole, comparable to Romania under the rule of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Hospitals in the provinces lack medicine, anesthetics, even running water. In the capital, shops do have goods on the shelves, but not that many. In a seven-story department store, the higher the floor, the fewer the products on display. By the seventh floor, stock had apparently run out and the whole floor was closed. One young man was seen buying a single pencil, a sure sign of how tight money is.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[And yet, amid this privation, there are pockets of unimaginable luxury. In the highest of the high-end stores, designer sportswear sits alongside watches costing $10,000 and Intel computers. The Egyptian telecom company Orascom boasts signing up 200,000 North Korean subscribers in less than two years. It's aiming for a million soon -- and mobile phones aren't cheap.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[In posh hotels, the favored few are openly sloshing back brandy with their Chinese business partners, despite international sanctions on luxury goods. It's a sure sign that -- despite the currency reform, despite the sanctions designed to target them -- the elite is still flourishing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Despite this glaring disparity of wealth, nobody -- not one person -- expressed any sign of dissatisfaction. Watching heir apparent Kim Jong Un appear on television, without any government minders present, a young man smiled and put his hand over his heart. At the rallies, the faithful wept with joy, to be blessed by the presence of their Dear Leader and his Young General.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[This is no surprise. Discontent is growing, especially after the currency reform. But shows of dissent are punished by terms in prison camps. Voicing such thoughts to a Westerner is unthinkable. In this Potemkin city, people have learned to censor their thoughts and their faces just to survive.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[First of four parts]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[A video opens with an ordinary young man standing in front a blackboard in a Florida community college classroom. He's about to embark on a rite of passage that everyone remembers and most everyone hates: the five-minute oral presentation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[There are jumper cables on the table in front of him. He touches them nervously before he smiles, introduces himself, and dives right in.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Hi, um, I'm Adnan," he looks down at his index cards for support, "and today we are going to learn how to jump-start a car."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[It was 1997. The man in the video is Adnan Shukrijumah, thought to be the highest-ranking American in al-Qaida. Intelligence officials believe he is 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed's successor, and since he left Florida in the spring of 2001, has made it his life's work to attack America.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah is one of a growing number of Americans who are showing up in key positions in al-Qaida and its affiliate groups, presenting a new challenge for law enforcement. They are enemies who are not only familiar with America, but also deeply understand it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[As it turns out, that videotape -- a shaky, badly lit film catching Shukrijumah on film 13 years ago -- ended up as a crucial piece of evidence in a terrorism plot directed at the U.S. last year: a plan to bomb transportation targets around New York City.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The suspect in that case, a longtime American resident named Najibullah Zazi, had traveled to Afghanistan in hopes of fighting U.S. forces there. He was convinced by an American al-Qaida operative there to follow a different path: return to the U.S. and strike there instead.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Zazi told authorities that said he didn't know the operative's name; he could only provide a vague description of what he looked like and the fact that he spoke perfect English. An FBI agent showed him the videotape of the student explaining how to jump-start a car.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Zazi identified Shukrijumah as the al-Qaida operative who had directed him to attack the New York City subways. (Earlier this year, Zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges connected to the subway bombing plot.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[In the video, Shukrijumah hardly looks lethal. Instead, he is thin and small, a little over 5 feet tall, wearing a button-down shirt and blue jeans. His hair is short and his beard close-cropped.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["First you keep your car running ... which is this with the happy battery," he says, pointing to a cube he's drawn on the blackboard to represent a fully charged car battery. It has a big smiley face on it. The dead battery is drawn with a frown.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah ends the presentation with a small bow.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[In Florida, Blending In]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Adnan Shukrijumah was born in 1975 and grew up in Trinidad and Saudi Arabia. His father was a religious scholar who was hired by the Saudi government to open mosques around the world. He opened one in Brooklyn. Later, he worked at one in Florida. Typically, he would travel to these cities and leave his wife and growing family behind.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[It wasn't until the 1990s that Shukrijumah got his first taste of America. It began with occasional visits to Brooklyn and then, eventually, a move with the rest of the family -- his mother and five brothers and sisters -- to Florida when Adnan was a teenager.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The oral presentation in the video was for an English class at Broward College, a sprawling campus about 11 miles from Miami, where he took classes for several years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[David Armstrong, the president of Broward  College, says Shukrijumah was a chemistry major at the school some 12 to 14 years ago and never graduated.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[On a recent morning, Armstrong is standing outside the Broward student center. Most of the students are working on laptops, oblivious to the school president's presence. Armstrong says literally every country in the world is represented by Broward's student body, so Shukrijumah would have blended right in.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah registered under the name Jumah El-Chukri and enrolled in chemistry, computer science and English language classes. Armstrong says he was a pretty good student. And until a couple of months ago, few had put together that Jumah El-Chukri, the community college chemistry major, and Adnan Shukrijumah, the al-Qaida operative, were one and the same.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[In fact, Shukrijumah's presence at Broward had become a bit of an urban myth. Rivka Spiro handles media for the college, and years ago, she heard about a student who might have been a terrorist.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["When I first got here, people were telling me about the college, and one of my colleagues said we have in our past a student who was alleged to be a terrorist," Spiro says. "She told me, 'Just so you know.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Urban myth met reality when a Broward professor stumbled on the Shukrijumah videotape and gave it to the FBI last year. The bureau didn't really have any specific use for it until last fall, when Shukrijumah was implicated in the subway bombing plot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[The 'Elvis Of Al-Qaida']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Joe Billy is the former assistant director of the counterterrorism division at FBI headquarters in Washington. He was one of the people responsible for tracking al-Qaida operatives like Shukrijumah. Billy thinks Shukrijumah is particularly dangerous because he chooses his operatives so carefully.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["Shukrijumah has always understood the importance of choosing operatives who know their targets," Billy says. "His philosophy has been, even years ago, to select and use operatives who come from the area they hope to launch attacks against," he adds. "And I think his strategies now are being employed more so than they have in years past."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[And it isn't just Najibullah Zazi who is an example of this. That strategy is showing  up across the board, as homegrown terrorist attacks in the U.S. have spiked in the past year. Terrorist groups had been having so much trouble getting operatives into the United States that they have decided to find people here who can vault over that hurdle. Zazi was a permanent resident who could come into the U.S. without raising red flags.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah himself is an embodiment of that strategy: He is a naturalized American, and U.S. intelligence says his No. 1 goal is to find ways to attack the U.S. -- the place that, for a time, was his adopted home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Law enforcement officials worry about Shukrijumah in particular because he has been able to travel anywhere and slip in and out of countries like a ghost melting through a wall.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Part of the reason is his physical appearance. His father is from Guyana and his mother is from Yemen. In short hair, he looks Hispanic. Put a beard on him, and he could pass for a Saudi or South Asian.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[What's more, he speaks nearly perfect English. He has a U.S. Social Security card and Florida driver's license.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[For years, FBI agents heard about an al-Qaida operative known only as the "South American" -- it turned out to be Shukrijumah.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Today, among intelligence officials, he's known as the Elvis of al-Qaida. That's because, like Elvis, there have been unsubstantiated sightings of him all over the world. And, to continue the metaphor, it seems law enforcement always gets there after he has left the building. Even the FBI's Billy can't be entirely sure that Shukrijumah hasn't come back to the U.S.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA["I don't believe he's been here," he says. "And if he has been here, then he has been successful at eluding and continuing to elude."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA['Getting Into The American Dream Life']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah's mother is somewhat easier to find. Zurah Adbu Ahmed still lives in the same one-story house behind a gas station and highway that she shared with her son all those years ago in Miramar, Fla. She is a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with a birdlike frailty and sweet brown eyes. She declined to go on tape because, in her words, everyone had already made their mind up about her son anyway.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[There has been a lot of speculation about why Adnan Shukrijumah joined forces with al-Qaida. His father was, rather famously, the interpreter for Sheik Abdul Rahman -- the blind sheik who was convicted of planning the 1993 World  Trade Center attacks. Officials say that connection was just a coincidence.]]></paragraph>

It is run by Sheik Shafayat Mohammed, a heavyset, jovial man from Trinidad. He hired Adnan Shukrijumah's father -- who is now deceased -- as a religious instructor years ago. And he says Adnan was allowed to lead prayers at the mosque.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[That's about the time, in 1996, that Shukrijumah signed up for classes at Broward. He started selling used cars and learning how to fix computers. He did whatever he could to hustle new jobs and make money.]]></paragraph>

He studied topography and clandestine surveillance and explosives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="54"><![CDATA[Because he had several passports, he could travel easily. Mohammed remembers after Shukrijumah returned to Florida he would disappear for weeks at a time. Officials say the trips were scouting missions for al-Qaida.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="57"><![CDATA[Now, all Shukrijumah leaves in his wake are terrorism plots. Officials say he was behind the 2004 foiled plot against financial targets in New York and New Jersey. He was tangentially tied to the plot to try to ignite fuel lines at John F.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Tamara Drewe is based on a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds, which was inspired by Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd; and after a spate of graphic-novel movies that aim, inexplicably, strenuously, and self-defeatingly to evoke their source material, it's a relief to find one that puts the spirit of the thing ahead of the form. Director Stephen Frears gets the feel of Simmonds' frames: busy but airy, the characters looking especially precarious against the fixed landscape.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Gemma Arterton's Tamara Drewe --a chatty lifestyle columnist for a London newspaper -- is the last character to arrive in this small English backwater, but she's the catalyst, setting everything in madcap motion. She has two key attributes: She's utterly gorgeous, showing up in a pair of short-shorts and riveting the gaze of men and women both. And she knows that her gorgeousness is provisional. She grew up with a near-Cyrano-sized honker she had fixed, and now she can't quite believe her new power.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Because this is Hardy-inspired, there's an unusually large number of perspectives. Tamsin Greig's Beth Hardiment owns this writer's retreat with her husband, bestselling mystery writer Nicholas. She doesn't just cook and clean; she's a kind of muse, giving him ideas and typing his handwritten drafts. But the aging fop cheats on her like mad -- which gives hope to the schlubby, radiantly unsuccessful Hardy scholar played by American stage actor Bill Camp. Perhaps, he thinks, Beth could be his muse. Luke Evans is the dreamy handyman who loves Tamara, Dominic Cooper the rock-star drummer who plays his sticks up and down her body to seduce her. And there are two local high-school girls, Casey and Jody, who sneak into Tamara's house and send a lascivious e-mail in her name that ushers in the apocalypse.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[In its unpretentious way, Tamara Drewe has the fullness of an 18th-century novel in which fate is inexorable, character equals destiny, and there are casualties. But in place of Hardy's pathos is a perverse little smile that's blessedly contagious.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[It's Kind of a Funny Story is also set on the border between funny and discomfiting. It opens with its narrator, Craig, played by Keir Gilchrist, having a vision of himself jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. Vaguely suicidal, he talks his way into a psychiatric ward. He has a dad played by Jim Gaffigan who's not particularly verbal but whose driving ambition for the boy has reduced him to a wreck. Craig has a best friend with a four-point-six grade point average (how, he asks, is that even possible?) and a relationship with the girl Craig adores. More pressing is an unfinished summer-school application that his father believes holds the key to future success.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[With all the ingredients for a self-pitying, narcissistic adolescent fantasy, the movie manages to be offhand. As in Ned Vizzini's endearingly nervous novel, directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden keep one eye on the protagonist and the other on the other patients. One is a girl who cuts herself who's played by the impossibly pretty Emma Roberts, and her immediate rapport with Craig is enough to make most teenage males think about signing themselves into the local hospital. Her character is a stretch. But the one who dominates the movie is slobby, bearded Zach Galifianakis' Bobby, who first appears to Craig in the emergency room waiting area dressed in a doctor's white coat and scrubs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Galifianakis is stunningly good. His Bobby describes himself as on vacation from the world -- and this is something of a working vacation for Galifianakis, too. He slows himself down, takes a breather from his manic comedian persona, and allows something melancholy and bitter to emerge. His Bobby understands the pressure Craig is under to perform.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[It's Kind of a Funny Story is too tidy and often too cute. What saves it is the directors' soft sell. It's not about breakthroughs, epiphanies, one-size-fits-all cures for depression. It's about seeing one's own confusion in a larger context and learning that misery really does love company.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As we reported earlier, the Swedish Academy has awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature to Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, currently a visiting lecturer in creative writing in the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University, in recognition of "his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[This afternoon, NPR spoke to the newly-named laureate. Earlier today, he received a phone call from Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["It was a big, big surprise," Vargas Llosa told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. "For a moment, I thought this could be a joke."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Almost an hour later, Englund told the world -- in three languages:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"/>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I thought that, when I came to New York, that I would have a very life here, for three months, or three and a half months," Vargas Llosa said. "And my impression is that it won't be so quiet as I wanted."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Kelly asked him if he planned to use the prize as a platform to make political statements. (In 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for Peru's presidency.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"/>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Let me say first that, although it is true that I have been participated in the political debate since i was young, I think it is very dangerous to use literature as a vehicle to promote political ideals. I think it is very risky because literature can become propaganda, and literature and propaganda are totally incompatible. I think literature can use politics, but that politics shouldn't use literature, because if it does, it destroys literature.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So, when I want to make a political statement, I write an essay, I write an article, or I give a lecture.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[I think that literature is something that embraces a much larger experience than politics. It's an expression of what is life, of what are all the dimensions of life. But politics is one among others.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"/>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Among the dozens he has authored, does Vargas Llosa have a favorite book?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"/>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Each book, for me, has been an adventure, a period of time dedicated to study, to document certain facts, to traveling and also to fantasize and to invent.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"/>
        <paragraph num="17"/>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[In general, a writer would like to think that the best book that he has written is the book that he is writing, and the next book will be even better. Maybe if this is not true, it is very useful to keep the illusion alive.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Since its publication in 1925, F. Scott's Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby has captured the American imagination.  The flamboyant story has been adapted for film, stage, television and even opera.  But one ambitious New York theater company has decided to put every word of the novel onstage in a 6 1/2-hour adaptation that's been getting rave reviews.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The Public Theater's Gatz opens with a man in a blue shirt walking out onto a set that doesn't even vaguely evoke F. Scott Fitzgerald’s jazz age.  It's the drabbest office imaginable: gray walls, beat-up furniture, a manual typewriter, an ancient computer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The man tries several times to boot up that computer, all unsuccessful.   Then, with a shrug, he pulls out a paperback copy of The Great Gatsby, and starts reading -- aloud.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[And for the next 6 1/2 hours -- plus two intermissions and a dinner break -- the audience is transported into the world of The Great Gatsby as the workers of this mysterious onstage office bring the novel to vivid life and, somehow, that guy in the blue shirt becomes Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald’s narrator, and the friend and confidant to self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA['A Truly Dynamic Work']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley calls the production improbable and exciting.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["It doesn't sound like innately dramatic material," Brantley says. "But this is a truly dynamic work. And it somehow finds a theatrical form for the very private act of reading."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[That's thanks, in large part, to director John Collins.  For the past 19 years, Collins has directed every production by Elevator Repair Service, the experimental theater group that will be performing the play through Nov. 28. He says creating theater out of the improbable is a fundamental part of their mission.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["We like things that give us some sort of problem to solve," Collins says. "That eventually became a kind of obsession with doing things that were wrong for the theater. You know, we liked material that didn't present any kind of obvious way to become a play."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So when one of their company members suggested adapting The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's keen-eyed look at the American dream, they all leapt at the opportunity and began rehearsing in a dingy office in downtown New York, a lot like the one onstage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["There was a certain resonance in a dumpy little office," Collins says of the play's setting.  "I mean, Nick, in the book, has a kind of humble job as a bond salesman and talks about how he doesn’t make much money.  It had resonance with the book, but it also was just, for me, a kind of mysterious canvas on which to project the book."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[So, as the guy in the blue shirt reads the novel, office workers drift in and out, doing their tasks -- delivering memos, picking up mail -- until they subtly begin to resemble the characters in the novel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Somewhere in the first 20 minutes, the worker who becomes Tom Buchanan blurts out a line of dialogue, and before you know it, scenes from The Great Gatsby -- like the drunken party in Myrtle Wilson's love nest -- are happening in the middle of an office, with paper and plastic cups flying all over the place.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA['Borne Back Ceaselessly Into The Past']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Collins, who had never read the novel before he started working on the show, says he was amazed at how well-suited the story was for the stage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I was surprised at how contemporary it felt, and I was surprised at how efficient yet lyrical it was," he says. "It was like a perfect poem.  I remember thinking that every word felt necessary."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[And so the decision was made, early on, to use every word.  But Scott Shepherd, the guy in the blue shirt, ends up saying most of them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["I've never run a marathon, but maybe it's kind of a similar thing.  It's too big, too long to hold in your head at once or to even really conceive of or think about or prepare for," Shepherd says. "All I know how to do is to go out there and open the book and start."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[It's a simple approach, but it works.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["Scott Shepherd is amazing," critic Ben Brantley says.  "He gives a performance that is very specific, that is taken over by the book, that's defined by the book. And at the same time he remains the universal reader, the constant reader. And I've never seen a balancing act quite like that in theater."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Shepherd starts the play as an anonymous office worker, but by the final hour, the book has been set aside and Shepherd is Nick Carraway.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[And then he delivers the last lines of Fitzgerald’s American classic:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["So, we beat on," Shepherd recites, "boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Those words ring true -- even today.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The city of Lahore in Pakistan has long been known as one of the artistic capitals of South Asia. But in recent years, religious extremists have set their sights on urban artists and staged attacks aimed at stifling their expression.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Despite the chill that has settled over the arts community, local artists are rising to the challenge.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In 2008, Sufi minstrels, puppeteers and actors gathered for the World Performing Arts Festival in Lahore. The festival organizers had received anonymous threats, but they went ahead with the shows.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[On the last night of the show, three bombs went off in succession, injuring several festival-goers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The only real casualty was the festival itself -- it's been discontinued.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Chilling Effects]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Festival organizer, painter and puppeteer Faizaan Peerzada says that to the extremists, his outfit, the Rafi Peer Theater Workshop, "is an organization which is spreading non-Islamic culture in this country and bringing nations that are not Muslim countries with their strange culture, which has been imposed on the minds of our civil society."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Peerzada finds that notion absurd. But multinational corporate funding for his cultural exchanges has dried up. And Peerzada is now building a concrete wall to protect his puppetry museum and arts center.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Lahore musicians cite another sign of the chilling effect of religious fundamentalists. Last year, concert promoters tried to gather Pakistan's top bands for a Woodstock-like concert, but security concerns forced the whole event out of the country and to Dubai.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Taimur Rahman, leader of the left-leaning folk-rock band Lal, says that in Pakistan his concert audiences have shrunk drastically.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["The overall climate of the country has changed so dramatically," he says. "Because of the campaign that these organizations have undertaken in the cities, our outreach is significantly challenged as a result. We can't hold big concerts, we can't hold open concerts, we can't hold street concerts -- although we do, but they have to be, sort of more guerrilla-type of concerts."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[On one of his albums, Rahman sings: "No daughter's life in this land shall be destroyed by fundamentalist rule."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[He says that extremist attacks have backfired, publicly discrediting the extremists. They've also rallied activist artists, including himself, to set their sights on a new threat.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["In an earlier period, the focus of our work was to roll back military dictatorship," he recounts. "And once that was rolled back and we had some semblance of a democratic government, or at least an elected government, then we felt that our new main focus would change to addressing the issue of religious extremism."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Artists Hopeful]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[In a class at the school of visual arts at Lahore's private Beaconhouse  National University, students and teachers are discussing projects.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The school's dean is prominent painter and writer Salima Hashmi, daughter of the famous Urdu-language poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. She says that she must sometimes advise students to consider whether their artwork will provoke a response from extremists.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Hashmi remembers growing up in a Lahore that was the "Paris of the East," with vibrant music, theater and cinema, and a lively intellectual scene. She notes that during the subcontinent's painful partition into India and Pakistan in 1947, Lahore lost many residents who migrated to India.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[But the city, Hashmi says, "still retained that flavor of being a place where writers would meet, coffeehouses where artists and writers would fight themselves blue in the face over some very tiny issue about abstract art or free verse, or whatever it was."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[She also remembers the all-night concerts of Sufi Muslim devotional music, or Qawali, at the Data Darbar, shrine to the patron saint of Lahore.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["And there'll be thousands and thousands of people who come from small villages," she explains. "They come with their whole families, and they're there to listen to the music, to participate in the music, to move to the music, to go into trance to the music."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[These gatherings have been curtailed since July, when two suicide bombers blew themselves up amid the crowds of worshippers, killing more than 40 people. The shrine is sacred to Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike, but Islamic fundamentalists consider worship of shrines and saints idolatrous.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Hashmi has seen the political seasons of repression and expression in Pakistan wax and wane. She and other locals are hopeful that when the current winter of extremism lifts, Lahore will be the first to burst into full artistic bloom.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["Lahore still knows how to party," she reassures with a knowing smile. "It is a city that loves to eat, as anybody will tell you. It is a city that is very discerning at a cricket match. Lahore is a city that enjoys a good laugh, and when times are tough, the best jokes come out."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[First of four parts]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[A video opens with an ordinary young man standing in front a blackboard in a Florida community college classroom. He's about to embark on a rite of passage that everyone remembers and most everyone hates: the five-minute oral presentation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[There are jumper cables on the table in front of him. He touches them nervously before he smiles, introduces himself, and dives right in.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Hi, um, I'm Adnan," he looks down at his index cards for support, "and today we are going to learn how to jump-start a car."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[It was 1997. The man in the video is Adnan Shukrijumah, thought to be the highest-ranking American in al-Qaida. Intelligence officials believe he is 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed's successor, and since he left Florida in the spring of 2001, has made it his life's work to attack America.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah is one of a growing number of Americans who are showing up in key positions in al-Qaida and its affiliate groups, presenting a new challenge for law enforcement. They are enemies who are not only familiar with America, but also deeply understand it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[As it turns out, that videotape -- a shaky, badly lit film catching Shukrijumah on film 13 years ago -- ended up as a crucial piece of evidence in a terrorism plot directed at the U.S. last year: a plan to bomb transportation targets around New York City.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The suspect in that case, a longtime American resident named Najibullah Zazi, had traveled to Afghanistan in hopes of fighting U.S. forces there. He was convinced by an American al-Qaida operative there to follow a different path: return to the U.S. and strike there instead.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Zazi told authorities that said he didn't know the operative's name; he could only provide a vague description of what he looked like and the fact that he spoke perfect English. An FBI agent showed him the videotape of the student explaining how to jump-start a car.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Zazi identified Shukrijumah as the al-Qaida operative who had directed him to attack the New York City subways. (Earlier this year, Zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges connected to the subway bombing plot.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[In the video, Shukrijumah hardly looks lethal. Instead, he is thin and small, a little over 5 feet tall, wearing a button-down shirt and blue jeans. His hair is short and his beard close-cropped.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["First you keep your car running ... which is this with the happy battery," he says, pointing to a cube he's drawn on the blackboard to represent a fully charged car battery. It has a big smiley face on it. The dead battery is drawn with a frown.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah ends the presentation with a small bow.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[In Florida, Blending In]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Adnan Shukrijumah was born in 1975 and grew up in Trinidad and Saudi Arabia. His father was a religious scholar who was hired by the Saudi government to open mosques around the world. He opened one in Brooklyn. Later, he worked at one in Florida. Typically, he would travel to these cities and leave his wife and growing family behind.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[It wasn't until the 1990s that Shukrijumah got his first taste of America. It began with occasional visits to Brooklyn and then, eventually, a move with the rest of the family -- his mother and five brothers and sisters -- to Florida when Adnan was a teenager.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The oral presentation in the video was for an English class at Broward College, a sprawling campus about 11 miles from Miami, where he took classes for several years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[David Armstrong, the president of Broward  College, says Shukrijumah was a chemistry major at the school some 12 to 14 years ago and never graduated.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[On a recent morning, Armstrong is standing outside the Broward student center. Most of the students are working on laptops, oblivious to the school president's presence. Armstrong says literally every country in the world is represented by Broward's student body, so Shukrijumah would have blended right in.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah registered under the name Jumah El-Chukri and enrolled in chemistry, computer science and English language classes. Armstrong says he was a pretty good student. And until a couple of months ago, few had put together that Jumah El-Chukri, the community college chemistry major, and Adnan Shukrijumah, the al-Qaida operative, were one and the same.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[In fact, Shukrijumah's presence at Broward had become a bit of an urban myth. Rivka Spiro handles media for the college, and years ago, she heard about a student who might have been a terrorist.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["When I first got here, people were telling me about the college, and one of my colleagues said we have in our past a student who was alleged to be a terrorist," Spiro says. "She told me, 'Just so you know.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Urban myth met reality when a Broward professor stumbled on the Shukrijumah videotape and gave it to the FBI last year. The bureau didn't really have any specific use for it until last fall, when Shukrijumah was implicated in the subway bombing plot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[The 'Elvis Of Al-Qaida']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Joe Billy is the former assistant director of the counterterrorism division at FBI headquarters in Washington. He was one of the people responsible for tracking al-Qaida operatives like Shukrijumah. Billy thinks Shukrijumah is particularly dangerous because he chooses his operatives so carefully.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["Shukrijumah has always understood the importance of choosing operatives who know their targets," Billy says. "His philosophy has been, even years ago, to select and use operatives who come from the area they hope to launch attacks against," he adds. "And I think his strategies now are being employed more so than they have in years past."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[And it isn't just Najibullah Zazi who is an example of this. That strategy is showing  up across the board, as homegrown terrorist attacks in the U.S. have spiked in the past year. Terrorist groups had been having so much trouble getting operatives into the United States that they have decided to find people here who can vault over that hurdle. Zazi was a permanent resident who could come into the U.S. without raising red flags.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah himself is an embodiment of that strategy: He is a naturalized American, and U.S. intelligence says his No. 1 goal is to find ways to attack the U.S. -- the place that, for a time, was his adopted home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Law enforcement officials worry about Shukrijumah in particular because he has been able to travel anywhere and slip in and out of countries like a ghost melting through a wall.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Part of the reason is his physical appearance. His father is from Guyana and his mother is from Yemen. In short hair, he looks Hispanic. Put a beard on him, and he could pass for a Saudi or South Asian.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[What's more, he speaks nearly perfect English. He has a U.S. Social Security card and Florida driver's license.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[For years, FBI agents heard about an al-Qaida operative known only as the "South American" -- it turned out to be Shukrijumah.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Today, among intelligence officials, he's known as the Elvis of al-Qaida. That's because, like Elvis, there have been unsubstantiated sightings of him all over the world. And, to continue the metaphor, it seems law enforcement always gets there after he has left the building. Even the FBI's Billy can't be entirely sure that Shukrijumah hasn't come back to the U.S.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA["I don't believe he's been here," he says. "And if he has been here, then he has been successful at eluding and continuing to elude."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA['Getting Into The American Dream Life']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah's mother is somewhat easier to find. Zurah Adbu Ahmed still lives in the same one-story house behind a gas station and highway that she shared with her son all those years ago in Miramar, Fla. She is a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with a birdlike frailty and sweet brown eyes. She declined to go on tape because, in her words, everyone had already made their mind up about her son anyway.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[There has been a lot of speculation about why Adnan Shukrijumah joined forces with al-Qaida. His father was, rather famously, the interpreter for Sheik Abdul Rahman -- the blind sheik who was convicted of planning the 1993 World  Trade Center attacks. Officials say that connection was just a coincidence.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[Shukrijumah's mother says her son never spent time with his father in New York. She and her children had been left behind in Trinidad and Saudi   Arabia.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[She says her son isn't a terrorist. She says he is just too sickly -- he has asthma. She says she hasn't heard from him in years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[About three miles from the Shukrijumah house in Florida, there's an Islamic Center called the Darul Uloom Institute. It is run by Sheik Shafayat Mohammed, a heavyset, jovial man from Trinidad. He hired Adnan Shukrijumah's father -- who is now deceased -- as a religious instructor years ago. And he says Adnan was allowed to lead prayers at the mosque.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA["He was really a nice, well-mannered boy," Mohammed says. "I must admit that by 199 percent, he was really liked by everybody."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[Adnan had a sense of humor, a certain charisma, and as the son of a mosque elder, people naturally looked up to him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[Mohammed says Adnan wasn't radical or even remotely anti-American. In fact, he was just the opposite.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA["You could see that there was in him that desire to enjoy cars, to enjoy the American dream and the American life," says Mohammed. "So at one point in time, maybe a couple of years after he came, you could see him getting into the American dream life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[That's about the time, in 1996, that Shukrijumah signed up for classes at Broward. He started selling used cars and learning how to fix computers. He did whatever he could to hustle new jobs and make money.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[Transformed By Afghanistan Trip]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA[And then, one day, Adnan Shukrijumah just disappeared, Mohammed says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="48"><![CDATA[Friends and relatives say he went to Afghanistan in the fall of 1998 or early 1999, about the time when the Taliban was consolidating its hold on the country.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="49"><![CDATA[Many young Muslims from around the world were going to Afghanistan at the time -- partly out of religious duty and partly motivated by the adventure of it all. It is unclear what inspired Shukrijumah.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="50"><![CDATA[What is clear is that when he came back, Shukrijumah was different, Mohammed says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="51"><![CDATA["He got a little more stern, a little more firm, a little more hard in his practices and his beliefs," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="52"><![CDATA[And they argued about religion, something they had never done before. Shukrijumah objected to some of the more progressive practices in the mosque.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="53"><![CDATA[Intelligence officials say Shukrijumah had been to an al-Qaida camp. Because of his asthma, he had been relegated to washing dishes and doing menial work. Then, in much the same way he hustled jobs in Florida, he worked his way up. He learned to handle AK-47s and automatic weapons. He studied topography and clandestine surveillance and explosives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="54"><![CDATA[Because he had several passports, he could travel easily. Mohammed remembers after Shukrijumah returned to Florida he would disappear for weeks at a time. Officials say the trips were scouting missions for al-Qaida.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="55"><![CDATA["Before 9-11 he disappeared totally," says Mohammed. "Last we saw him around here was May of 2001."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="56"><![CDATA[After that, officials say there were sightings of him everywhere: Trinidad, Saudi Arabia, Germany. But officials never seemed to get to any of these places in time to capture him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="57"><![CDATA[Now, all Shukrijumah leaves in his wake are terrorism plots. Officials say he was behind the 2004 foiled plot against financial targets in New York and New Jersey. He was tangentially tied to the plot to try to ignite fuel lines at John F. Kennedy airport in 2007. And then he resurfaced in last year's subway plot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="58"><![CDATA[He has been indicted in the Zazi case, and the U.S. government has placed a $5 million bounty on his head. Officials believe he has set his sights on one goal: to launch a successful attack against the country where he once lived.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Tamara Drewe is based on a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds, which was inspired by Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd; and after a spate of graphic-novel movies that aim, inexplicably, strenuously, and self-defeatingly to evoke their source material, it's a relief to find one that puts the spirit of the thing ahead of the form. Director Stephen Frears gets the feel of Simmonds' frames: busy but airy, the characters looking especially precarious against the fixed landscape.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Gemma Arterton's Tamara Drewe --a chatty lifestyle columnist for a London newspaper -- is the last character to arrive in this small English backwater, but she's the catalyst, setting everything in madcap motion. She has two key attributes: She's utterly gorgeous, showing up in a pair of short-shorts and riveting the gaze of men and women both. And she knows that her gorgeousness is provisional. She grew up with a near-Cyrano-sized honker she had fixed, and now she can't quite believe her new power.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Because this is Hardy-inspired, there's an unusually large number of perspectives. Tamsin Greig's Beth Hardiment owns this writer's retreat with her husband, bestselling mystery writer Nicholas. She doesn't just cook and clean; she's a kind of muse, giving him ideas and typing his handwritten drafts. But the aging fop cheats on her like mad -- which gives hope to the schlubby, radiantly unsuccessful Hardy scholar played by American stage actor Bill Camp. Perhaps, he thinks, Beth could be his muse. Luke Evans is the dreamy handyman who loves Tamara, Dominic Cooper the rock-star drummer who plays his sticks up and down her body to seduce her. And there are two local high-school girls, Casey and Jody, who sneak into Tamara's house and send a lascivious e-mail in her name that ushers in the apocalypse.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[In its unpretentious way, Tamara Drewe has the fullness of an 18th-century novel in which fate is inexorable, character equals destiny, and there are casualties. But in place of Hardy's pathos is a perverse little smile that's blessedly contagious.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[It's Kind of a Funny Story is also set on the border between funny and discomfiting. It opens with its narrator, Craig, played by Keir Gilchrist, having a vision of himself jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. Vaguely suicidal, he talks his way into a psychiatric ward. He has a dad played by Jim Gaffigan who's not particularly verbal but whose driving ambition for the boy has reduced him to a wreck. Craig has a best friend with a four-point-six grade point average (how, he asks, is that even possible?) and a relationship with the girl Craig adores. More pressing is an unfinished summer-school application that his father believes holds the key to future success.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[With all the ingredients for a self-pitying, narcissistic adolescent fantasy, the movie manages to be offhand. As in Ned Vizzini's endearingly nervous novel, directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden keep one eye on the protagonist and the other on the other patients. One is a girl who cuts herself who's played by the impossibly pretty Emma Roberts, and her immediate rapport with Craig is enough to make most teenage males think about signing themselves into the local hospital. Her character is a stretch. But the one who dominates the movie is slobby, bearded Zach Galifianakis' Bobby, who first appears to Craig in the emergency room waiting area dressed in a doctor's white coat and scrubs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Galifianakis is stunningly good. His Bobby describes himself as on vacation from the world -- and this is something of a working vacation for Galifianakis, too. He slows himself down, takes a breather from his manic comedian persona, and allows something melancholy and bitter to emerge. His Bobby understands the pressure Craig is under to perform.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[It's Kind of a Funny Story is too tidy and often too cute. What saves it is the directors' soft sell. It's not about breakthroughs, epiphanies, one-size-fits-all cures for depression. It's about seeing one's own confusion in a larger context and learning that misery really does love company.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As we reported earlier, the Swedish Academy has awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature to Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, currently a visiting lecturer in creative writing in the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University, in recognition of "his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[This afternoon, NPR spoke to the newly-named laureate. Earlier today, he received a phone call from Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["It was a big, big surprise," Vargas Llosa told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. "For a moment, I thought this could be a joke."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Almost an hour later, Englund told the world -- in three languages:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"/>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I thought that, when I came to New York, that I would have a very life here, for three months, or three and a half months," Vargas Llosa said. "And my impression is that it won't be so quiet as I wanted."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Kelly asked him if he planned to use the prize as a platform to make political statements. (In 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for Peru's presidency.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"/>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Let me say first that, although it is true that I have been participated in the political debate since i was young, I think it is very dangerous to use literature as a vehicle to promote political ideals. I think it is very risky because literature can become propaganda, and literature and propaganda are totally incompatible. I think literature can use politics, but that politics shouldn't use literature, because if it does, it destroys literature.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So, when I want to make a political statement, I write an essay, I write an article, or I give a lecture.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[I think that literature is something that embraces a much larger experience than politics. It's an expression of what is life, of what are all the dimensions of life. But politics is one among others.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Since its publication in 1925, F. Scott's Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby has captured the American imagination.  The flamboyant story has been adapted for film, stage, television and even opera.  But one ambitious New York theater company has decided to put every word of the novel onstage in a 6 1/2-hour adaptation that's been getting rave reviews.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The Public Theater's Gatz opens with a man in a blue shirt walking out onto a set that doesn't even vaguely evoke F. Scott Fitzgerald’s jazz age.  It's the drabbest office imaginable: gray walls, beat-up furniture, a manual typewriter, an ancient computer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The man tries several times to boot up that computer, all unsuccessful.   Then, with a shrug, he pulls out a paperback copy of The Great Gatsby, and starts reading -- aloud.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[And for the next 6 1/2 hours -- plus two intermissions and a dinner break -- the audience is transported into the world of The Great Gatsby as the workers of this mysterious onstage office bring the novel to vivid life and, somehow, that guy in the blue shirt becomes Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald’s narrator, and the friend and confidant to self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA['A Truly Dynamic Work']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley calls the production improbable and exciting.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["It doesn't sound like innately dramatic material," Brantley says. "But this is a truly dynamic work. And it somehow finds a theatrical form for the very private act of reading."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[That's thanks, in large part, to director John Collins.  For the past 19 years, Collins has directed every production by Elevator Repair Service, the experimental theater group that will be performing the play through Nov. 28. He says creating theater out of the improbable is a fundamental part of their mission.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["We like things that give us some sort of problem to solve," Collins says. "That eventually became a kind of obsession with doing things that were wrong for the theater. You know, we liked material that didn't present any kind of obvious way to become a play."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So when one of their company members suggested adapting The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's keen-eyed look at the American dream, they all leapt at the opportunity and began rehearsing in a dingy office in downtown New York, a lot like the one onstage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["There was a certain resonance in a dumpy little office," Collins says of the play's setting.  "I mean, Nick, in the book, has a kind of humble job as a bond salesman and talks about how he doesn’t make much money.  It had resonance with the book, but it also was just, for me, a kind of mysterious canvas on which to project the book."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[So, as the guy in the blue shirt reads the novel, office workers drift in and out, doing their tasks -- delivering memos, picking up mail -- until they subtly begin to resemble the characters in the novel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Somewhere in the first 20 minutes, the worker who becomes Tom Buchanan blurts out a line of dialogue, and before you know it, scenes from The Great Gatsby -- like the drunken party in Myrtle Wilson's love nest -- are happening in the middle of an office, with paper and plastic cups flying all over the place.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA['Borne Back Ceaselessly Into The Past']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Collins, who had never read the novel before he started working on the show, says he was amazed at how well-suited the story was for the stage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I was surprised at how contemporary it felt, and I was surprised at how efficient yet lyrical it was," he says. "It was like a perfect poem.  I remember thinking that every word felt necessary."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[And so the decision was made, early on, to use every word.  But Scott Shepherd, the guy in the blue shirt, ends up saying most of them.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["I've never run a marathon, but maybe it's kind of a similar thing.  It's too big, too long to hold in your head at once or to even really conceive of or think about or prepare for," Shepherd says. "All I know how to do is to go out there and open the book and start."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[It's a simple approach, but it works.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["Scott Shepherd is amazing," critic Ben Brantley says.  "He gives a performance that is very specific, that is taken over by the book, that's defined by the book. And at the same time he remains the universal reader, the constant reader. And I've never seen a balancing act quite like that in theater."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Shepherd starts the play as an anonymous office worker, but by the final hour, the book has been set aside and Shepherd is Nick Carraway.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[And then he delivers the last lines of Fitzgerald’s American classic:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["So, we beat on," Shepherd recites, "boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The city of Lahore in Pakistan has long been known as one of the artistic capitals of South Asia. But in recent years, religious extremists have set their sights on urban artists and staged attacks aimed at stifling their expression.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Despite the chill that has settled over the arts community, local artists are rising to the challenge.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In 2008, Sufi minstrels, puppeteers and actors gathered for the World Performing Arts Festival in Lahore. The festival organizers had received anonymous threats, but they went ahead with the shows.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Chilling Effects]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Festival organizer, painter and puppeteer Faizaan Peerzada says that to the extremists, his outfit, the Rafi Peer Theater Workshop, "is an organization which is spreading non-Islamic culture in this country and bringing nations that are not Muslim countries with their strange culture, which has been imposed on the minds of our civil society."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Peerzada finds that notion absurd. But multinational corporate funding for his cultural exchanges has dried up. And Peerzada is now building a concrete wall to protect his puppetry museum and arts center.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Lahore musicians cite another sign of the chilling effect of religious fundamentalists. Last year, concert promoters tried to gather Pakistan's top bands for a Woodstock-like concert, but security concerns forced the whole event out of the country and to Dubai.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Taimur Rahman, leader of the left-leaning folk-rock band Lal, says that in Pakistan his concert audiences have shrunk drastically.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["The overall climate of the country has changed so dramatically," he says. "Because of the campaign that these organizations have undertaken in the cities, our outreach is significantly challenged as a result. We can't hold big concerts, we can't hold open concerts, we can't hold street concerts -- although we do, but they have to be, sort of more guerrilla-type of concerts."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The school's dean is prominent painter and writer Salima Hashmi, daughter of the famous Urdu-language poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Three years ago this month, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad famously told a New York audience that Iran doesn't have any homosexuals. An aide later clarified that Ahmadinejad meant that Iran doesn't have many homosexuals compared with America.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Human rights groups say the Islamic republic continues to execute homosexuals. Gay and lesbian Iranians are increasingly among those fleeing the country.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[One young Iranian who fled to Turkey says he was targeted by authorities for two offenses: going public with his homosexuality and taking part in last year's post-election anti-government protests.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Ramin Haghjoo, 25, who is slender with a red streak in his long, curly hair, still laughs when he recalls the incident.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[His smile vanishes, however, when he talks about what it's like to live as a gay man in Iran. In an Istanbul cafe, Haghjoo spoke of friends estranged from their families, living in fear and depression, wondering if their future holds prison or worse.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["We live our lives but in secret," Haghjoo says. "You never know when the authorities will come after you. At the moment, there's a kid named Ebrahim Hamidi, they're planning to execute him. It's so easy for that to happen these days."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Haghjoo went to Turkey in May, fully intending to return to Tehran and his family. But now he's applying for asylum to the United States and says he can't go back as long as the current government holds power. He says he would face arrest not just for his sexuality but for taking part in the protests that rocked Iran in 2009 after the elections, which were attacked as fraudulent, that returned Ahmadinejad to power.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Despite a media blackout, Iranians managed to post on the Internet glimpses and sounds of their demonstrations and the brutal repression by pro-regime forces. Haghjoo says a week after the election, he and some friends took to the streets, and he remembers feeling excited and happy to see the crowds protesting the election results -- right up until the moment he was shot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["I remember seeing a woman crossing the alley and a Basij militia guy aiming his gun at her," Haghjoo recalls. "I shouted, and she ran back. Then I noticed the Basij was now aiming at us. I started to turn away when I heard the shot. I was on the ground. I couldn't breathe; cold sweat was pouring off me. People carried me into a house. I pulled up my shirt and saw something that looked like my intestine sticking out. After about a half-hour, a guy knocked at the door and said, 'I have a van.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[After finding the local hospitals swarming with security, Haghjoo says, he was driven to a private hospital far from the demonstrations, where they told the doctors he'd had a bicycle accident.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[While he was in the recovery room, he says, a man came up to him and asked questions. In a haze of sedatives, Haghjoo told him he'd been shot. When the doctor found out about the inquisitive visitor, he immediately signed Haghjoo's release papers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Haghjoo says he escaped the notice of the security forces until this May, when he was visiting Turkey. The previous fall he had agreed to be part of a friend's documentary about Iran's gay community and the opposition Green movement.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[While he was in Turkey, Voice of America interviewed him and broadcast a part of the documentary in which he talked about being shot during the protests, and about Ahmadinejad's views on homosexuality.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The next day, he was told, security forces raided his house in Tehran and took his father for questioning. Haghjoo went straight to the U.N. refugee agency and applied for asylum.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["I realized I can never go back until the government changes -- so I'm trying to find somewhere I can fight for the rights of Iranians," Haghjoo says.]]></paragraph>

Haghjoo has run afoul of the regime on both counts, and he wonders when he will draw his next breath in his homeland.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The White House is trying this week to re-energize college students and young voters who played a big role in President Obama's election two years ago. Polls show they still support him and the Democrats, though not by the record margin they did in 2008.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Obama held a huge rally at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Other administration officials -- including Vice President Joe Biden, who went to Penn State -- have fanned out across the country as well.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Young people -- voters younger than 30 -- went for Obama in 2008 by a 2-1 margin. They were excited, they were involved, and they used the Internet to drive election organizing like never before.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[In the heart of campus at Penn State, Biden told a packed ballroom of mostly students that it's critical that they not let up this year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["I'm asking you all to keep the enthusiasm; it's harder now," he said. "Keep the phone calls going like you did for us the last time. Knock on doors like you did for us last time. Most important, I need you to commit to vote this fall."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Outside, volunteers waved clipboards looking for students who haven't registered to vote.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Beyond getting a signature on a form, the trick is to motivate college students and other young voters who traditionally have lower turnout rates than the population as a whole.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Penn State freshman Connor Mariani said he is still a big supporter of the president. He said he's voting for sure this year, but he added that he does find himself having to defend Obama.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Yesterday, we met a political science major, and we're like, 'Oh, are you going to the ... Biden thing?' And she's like, 'I'm not going to listen to that ... socialist person.' I’m like, 'They're not socialist.' I mean, they're definitely more left. But they're not trying to harm anyone. They're not trying to take complete control. They're just trying to help."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Mariani said he is definitely voting this year, but more typical is Chardae Harris, a sophomore, who said she's not following the election closely.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["School is taking up all my time," she said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Two years ago, Harris was an active Obama campaign volunteer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["I haven't even really been watching TV. And, to a certain extent, especially for, like, a college student, that's really where you get most of your information with school and stuff like that," she said. "So if I don't have time to watch TV, I don't really have time to catch up on it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[With so many potentially close races this year, Democrats are concerned that such ambivalence will take a toll in November.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research  Center for the People and the Press, says voters younger than 30 are still the single best age group for Obama. But instead of the 34-point margin these voters gave the president over John McCain in 2008, latest polling shows that in this year's U.S. House races, young voters give Democrats just a 4-point edge over Republicans. Keeter says economic worries are a big part of it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["The economy, in particular, arguably may be hurting young people more than it is other age groups: last hired, first fired; or maybe they never got hired in the first place. They may have to move back in with their parents," he says. "And so it's not surprising that some of their confidence in the Democratic Party and in Obama himself would be shaken."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Although polls still show that young people have a positive view of government, and though they are far more liberal on social issues than the GOP, Republicans see an opportunity.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[About 50 members of the Penn State College Republicans gathered on Tuesday night, a few hours after Biden's rally, at a campus building known as the HUB. There was no apathy there.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["Just the fact that college students were outside the HUB at 8 a.m., not only at 8 a.m. but in the pouring rain at 8 a.m., really shows how passionate we are about taking back our seats in November," sophomore Maggie Quinn told the group.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Ethan Wolfinger, who was among those present, smiled as he thought about what a difference two years make.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["I could probably name about five McCain supporters, and as far as the people that were political, there was probably at least 100 people that liked Obama," he said. "So it was definitely a big shift."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[But Quinn also told the group that the election is still more than a month away -- and they have to keep at it. In the meantime, they will enjoy the fact that this election, it's somebody else's turn to play the underdog.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[If you walk the halls of an elementary school, you're likely to see a lot of "metal mouths." Many parents are now opting for early orthodontic treatment, and the American Association of Orthodontists recommends that children see an orthodontist for an evaluation no later than age 7. But research shows there are often advantages to deferring treatment, though decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["There's been a number of studies that have shown for some very common problems that you're better off waiting until all the permanent teeth have come in first before treatment is started," says Robert Williams, a board certified orthodontist who teaches at the University of Maryland.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Common problems that fall into the "better-to-defer" category include conditions such as overjets -- that's when teeth protrude or stick out -- or crooked teeth that just need simple straightening.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["Many years ago, you wouldn't do anything until the permanent teeth were all in," says Antonino Secchi, a professor of orthodontics at the University of Pennsylvania. Now he says if parents opt to treat an overjet early -- say at age 9 -- the child may end up needing another phase of intervention a few years down the road.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["And at the end, instead of having two years of orthodontics, you end up having four years of orthodontics," Secchi says. And he says this can be much more expensive. "Instead of paying one bill, you pay two bills."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Evaluating Treatment Options]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Orthodontists have varying payment structures. Sometimes families are given a break or a discount on a second phase of treatment. "You want to get the most bang for the least number of bucks," Williams says. So, when parents are trying to decide on the best treatment plan, he says, they should ask questions until they understand the pros and cons of each option.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["I definitely asked a lot of questions," says Mary Bateman, whose 9-year-old daughter Rachel is being treated for a crossbite. That's when upper teeth bite down on the inside of the lower teeth. If left untreated, it could lead to problems like damaging the gum tissue.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["This is the kind of problem that we pretty much always treat early," Williams says. Other conditions that warrant early intervention include overbites or severe crowding.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[In Rachel's case, the ideal time to intervene is between the ages of 6 and 9.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["When the baby teeth are still in, we have more treatment options because we have more flexibility in moving the teeth," Williams says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The Batemans ended up at the University of Maryland orthodontic clinic after an evaluation by another orthodontist recommended an expander to correct the overbite. "I didn't just jump into it," says Mary Bateman. Over the course of getting orthodontic treatment for her three older children, she learned that expanders aren't the best option for every case, though many orthodontists recommend them in certain circumstances.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["In some cases expansion of the upper arch [using an expander] is not a stable position," Williams says. He opted to treat Rachel Bateman's overbite by extracting a few baby teeth and putting on braces to move a problem tooth. Williams says some people don't realize that expansion may relapse and not hold, so some patients may need to wear retainers indefinitely to maintain the extra space in their mouths.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Form Vs. Function]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Orthodontists have varying approaches, and there isn't one right way or wrong way to treat a problem. Patients, likewise, have different expectations. Many parents put a strong emphasis on a beautiful smile over fixing functional dental problems. This is the case with Pamika Lee, the mother of 15-year-old Quinique Jones.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I looked at her teeth today, and they are beautiful," Lee says. "Perfect."  Jones is about to get her braces off, and Lee says her daughter's self-confidence is already improved.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[As orthodontists blend aesthetic, or cosmetic, interventions with the business of fixing dental problems, people who have just marginal cases of crooked or crowded teeth are increasingly opting for treatment. Lee says she's considering it herself -- when she can afford it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["I may get braces soon," Lee says. And she'll be in good company -- the American Association of Orthodontists now says 1 in 5 new patients is an adult.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["Some of my patients are in their 60s and 70s," Williams says. "It's never too late."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long been the standard bearer of leftist populism in South America, but there is another populist leader in the country who is leftist and connects with the crowds: Henri Falcon, the governor of a small state who is helping lead a breakaway political party against Chavez.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[This Sunday, Falcon's party may change the balance of power in congressional elections.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Waking Up with Henri]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Falcon gets up early in Barquisimeto, his signature baseball cap down low. Before dawn, he's in the poorest districts of Lara, his largely rural state.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[He calls it Waking Up with Henri, and the idea is simple: Any given morning, the governor and his aides could show up at your door and see what you need.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Walking into a tiny store, Falcon says its owner, Marjory Suarez, needs a small loan. He says the Venezuela he wants to build needs to provide people like her with a safety net.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Suarez, a single mother, smiles broadly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["There's no one like Henri," she says in Spanish. "He's always provided me with help."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Political Success]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Moments later, Falcon is in a crowd, receiving letters from residents -– wish lists from people who want him to resolve their problems. He easily mingles in a crowd, remembering names, recalling people's stories.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[That has paid off politically. He was twice mayor of Barquisimeto, the state capital, and he won the governorship in 2008 with ease.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Until recently, that made him an important ally for Chavez. But Falcon broke with the president and joined Fatherland for All, a small leftist party that had once supported Chavez.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["With Chavez," Falcon says in Spanish, "there is no second-guessing, no debating, no consensus building."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[He says 95 percent of Venezuelans want an end to confrontation and hate. Falcon blames Chavez, saying the president has become increasingly autocratic. But he also is wary of the opposition.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["The solution," he says, "is a move to the center, with Fatherland for All playing a key role."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Criticism From Chavez ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Making such plans a reality will not be easy. Chavez retains popular support in many poor districts. And the president is constantly campaigning, his speeches televised in full on several state television channels.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[On his weekly TV show, Chavez called Falcon a traitor and a coward. He also said Falcon is out to topple his government.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[But the political reality in Venezuela is that Chavez is facing a challenge. Polls show that Venezuelans are tired of rampant crime, high inflation and food shortages. They also show that the president's foes may stop Chavez's allies from winning the two-thirds the government wants in Congress.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[There is even a possibility that Chavez's foes could eke out a majority –- particularly if Fatherland for All can win seven or eight seats.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Counting On Support]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Jose Simon Calzadilla is among the party's candidates. He says the party is angling to become the second-strongest movement in Venezuela, after Chavez’s socialist movement.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[It's counting on people like Miriam Escalante, the principal of a public school. She says she regrets supporting Chavez, saying the country has been hard-hit by corruption and polarization.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[As Escalante speaks, Falcon wades into a crowd of teachers and students at her school.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[For a moment, it seems as if the people here, at least, have already decided who'll be their leader.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Life in Russia, in many ways, is much like life in the United   States. A day in Moscow feels very much like a day in any American big city. People rush to and from work in cars, or on the bus or subway. After work, it's home to the family, or a stop at the gym.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Still, there are differences. Because the police and justice system are riddled with corruption, there's a feeling that if something happens to you on the street, you have no place to turn.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[I was especially worried about two gay friends who came to visit me in Moscow. The city has a history of harassment against openly gay men. And the same goes for blacks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Even though for decades the Soviet Union recruited African students to come to universities and learn about communism, there are very few black faces in Russia today.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Skinheads are active in the capital and elsewhere, and blacks have been harassed on the street and beaten on trains and the subway.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[So, this summer, when I heard that a black man had been elected councilman in Novozavidovo, a small town 60 miles north of Moscow, I knew I had to go meet him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The Obama Of Russia]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Jean Gregoire Sagbo has dark rich eyes, an infectious smile and salt-and-pepper hair, which you'd think would be grayer after all he's been through. He was born in the West African nation of Benin and came to the Soviet Union in 1982 as a student. Back then, some Russians had a name for Sagbo and other black students: "monkeys."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Sagbo told me he kept hearing the word "monkey" on the street. So he asked his Russian teacher what it meant. She said: "Where did you hear it? They weren't saying it about you. Such things don't happen here."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[But such things did happen. And worse.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Sagbo fell in love with a Russian girl at his institute named Svetlana. When she became pregnant, she was kicked out of the institute for dating a "foreigner," and her mother beat her. The couple struggled for acceptance, living for a time in Benin, returning to Russia, and finally discovering peace in Novozavidovo. Sagbo got a job and quietly made a name for himself, helping those in need. Residents started calling him Santa Claus -- and earlier this year elected him to the town council.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[He is the first black elected to public office in Russian history. You can understand why he's been nicknamed Russia's Obama, but it's something he's not too pleased about.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["The Obama of Russia, just because I'm black?" Sagbo says. "If you say that I'm as serious a person as he is, working for the good of the country I live in, then yes, sure. However I don't like this cynical boasting of, 'Look, we've got our own Obama too!' No. That I don't like."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Still, Sagbo says, his sense of responsibility extends beyond the town.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["This is the first time anyone from the entire African continent has managed to become elected here," he told me. "My responsibility is to not fail. If I fail, it would be an embarrassment for my entire race. And I wouldn't want them to say that I failed because I am black. So I must do well, very well."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Worries About Physical Attacks]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[In Novozavidovo, I found that Sagbo is seen as an honest, hard-working man. Near the train station, resident Tatyana Fomkina shrugged when I asked her about the race of her councilman.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["What's the difference?" she asked. "As long as he is a good leader, and a good person, that's all that matters."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[But here's the ugly truth: The ease with which Sagbo walks the streets of Novozavidovo is not something he feels in the rest of the country. He won't get on the train to Moscow. He drives. Skinheads are active in the capital and elsewhere, and blacks -- not to mention other minorities like central Asians -- have been beaten on trains and on the Moscow subway.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[The Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy, an outreach group, surveyed about 200 Africans in Moscow -- and found that more than half had suffered physical attacks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Sagbo's wife, Svetlana, says she worries about her husband, and her sons who live in Moscow.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["Racism does exist and it hasn't gone away," she says. "Whenever my husband goes on TV, I always tell him to keep his family out of it. Don't show me; don't show our sons."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[After I return to Russia, I'll be checking in with Sagbo and his family to see how he's doing.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Big, meat-eating animals are in trouble. At least if they're not human.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[They eat what we like to eat. Sometimes they eat us, so we kill them. Or pave their habitats. This is especially true of the big cats: lions in Africa, tigers in Asia and Russia, and big cats in the Americas.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But one group -- the Florida panther -- is making a comeback.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Florida panthers are the same species as the Western puma, also known as the cougar or the mountain lion. But the panthers have adapted to living in the Florida swamps.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[By 1995, there were only about 25 Florida panthers left. And Melody Roelke, a veterinarian who has tracked them for years, says they were a mess: suffering from heart disease, infertility and undescended testicles.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["[With] the males, even with one testis, the quality of that sperm was just abysmal," she says. They just couldn't reproduce. "We were actually watching the extinction process right in front of our eyes. And this is what happens with small populations and inbreeding of close relatives."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Roelke waded through swamps and dodged rattlesnakes to follow panthers. But in Florida, the cats looked hopeless. "It was devastating -- in fact so devastating that I decided to move to Africa because the battle was over," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Saving The Panthers]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But a geneticist who studies big carnivores, Stephen O'Brien of the National Cancer Institute, devised a plan to save the panthers: He combined genetics and math to calculate the panther's fate.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["They were going to go extinct in 25 years with a 99 percent probability if we left them alone," he says. "That's what stimulated the decision to act, to intervene."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[He helped persuade the federal government to capture eight female pumas in Texas and release them in Florida to mate with the panthers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[That was a controversial move. The Endangered Species Act advises against mixing subspecies (here, for example, pumas and panthers). But O'Brien argued that Eastern and Western pumas had been interbreeding for millennia before highways and housing developments intervened: This would not be a "man-made" creature.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Others said, "Why bother?" -- there were enough pumas out West. O'Brien countered that subspecies may have traits developed within their isolated habitat that make them special. Even Darwin, he says, believed that subspecies could, under the right circumstances, become a unique species someday.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[So the Texas cats came to Florida. And to see whether the plan was working, scientists tracked every panther, as well its offspring. Roelke came back from Africa -- now sporting a cheetah scar on her leg -- and signed on with the National Cancer Institute group. She led teams of cat-tracking dogs into the cypress swamps.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["[The dogs] get within less than half a mile of where the cats are, and then the scent is so strong, the dogs are so excited they just let loose and they bay and they start running," she says. "The cat then typically will run and jump up a tree."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[A marksman then shoots the cat with a dart full of anesthetic. "Then we have a very brave field person who actually climbs up the tree with the cat semi-awake and puts a harness, a rope around their chest, and then we lower them into a net."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Scientists then take blood and tissue samples as well as DNA from the panther to monitor its health and reproductive viability.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["Arnold Schwarzenegger Versions Of Cats"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Before the Texas females arrived, the Florida panthers were, according to Roelke, pretty lame. "They would be lying there in the tree like, 'Oh, just let me just die up here,' because they lacked any kind of vigor."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Now, 15 years later, O'Brien says the Florida panther is a new cat. "I think we can say cautiously that it was the right decision," he says. "The population increased in number threefold. The admixture cats, which are hybrids, are more robust and they look a little bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger versions of cats."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Writing in the journal Science, O'Brien says the animals' DNA shows that the hybrids are the healthiest of the litter.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Craig Packer, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota who has worked with lions in Africa, says the project is a textbook case of how dangerous inbreeding can be, even in wild animals.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["The importance of this study is to really emphasize not only that this population really did suffer substantial costs of inbreeding, but that it was relatively easy to resolve by bringing in a small number of new animals to the population," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Packer says introducing new genes raises the chances that an isolated group can resist novel diseases or genetic defects. He says it could help keep other big cats -- tigers in Asia and Russia and lions in Africa -- from going extinct.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[He says insisting on genetic purity for a subspecies is akin to "stamp collecting." As important as keeping rare species from disappearing, he says, is keeping ecosystems -- including its top predators -- reasonably intact. Creating a hybrid in Florida is a "compromise," Parker says, that restores the ecosystem to something like its natural state.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[But few groups of wild animals are like the Florida panthers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["It was a well-studied population prior to the introduction, and then the follow-up was obviously well-studied after," says Warren Johnson, one of the National Cancer Institute team members. He says knowing the genetics of the Eastern and Western groups helped determine whether the experiment might work. Results now help to assess whether the animals are getting genetically more robust and more physically fit.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Even now, though, the Florida panthers aren't out of the woods. O'Brien says 100 panthers aren't quiite enough to stop inbreeding altogether. On the other hand, more panthers mean they will literally be out of the woods.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["A lot of people don't want to have cougars in their backyard when they're raising their kids and their little dogs," says O'Brien, "and I think that this is a reasonable fear." That's one of the reasons the Florida panther almost went extinct.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[O'Brien says the solution is to find new habitats for the rejuvenated panthers. And he's talking with wildlife officials in Eastern states to find one.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[On that fateful day, my friend Bill and I were spending the holidays with our families in northern New Mexico. We decided to drive out and visit the Monastery of Christ in the Desert, a community of Benedictine monks who live in a starkly beautiful, remote location near the town of Abiquiu, about an hour and a half's drive northwest of Santa Fe. They pass their days in manual labor, study, prayer and contemplation.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[I was wearing socks and sandals; Bill had on a hoodie. The sun was setting and the temperature was dropping below freezing. We hiked to the monastery -- my toes nearly frostbit -- figuring the brothers would have a spiffy, four-wheel-drive Jeep and tow chain to pull us out, and soon we’d be on our way back to our New Year's Eve party for an evening of steaks, tequila and merriment. It didn't turn out that way.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[After a shivery mile, we entered the monastery grounds and tried to question the first figure we met -- a monk in a black habit. When I tried to explain our predicament, he put his finger to his mouth (shhhh) and hurried away. We wandered over to the guesthouse and met an intense, kindly man in a knit cap, down jacket and hiking boots who gave his name as Robert Kyr. He told us he was staying at the monastery composing music, which didn't really register with me at the time. After making a sat-phone call to the closest city, Espanola, Kyr reported that the wrecker driver wouldn't venture out to get us on New Year's Eve. We were stuck for the night.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[So Kyr introduced us to Brother John, the "guestmaster" -– the monk appointed by the abbot to deal with visitors. (Brother John, a wry Englishman, at one point in our unplanned sojourn smiled at us benevolently and said, "Bless you and damn you.") He saw to it that we had two places at the long tables where guests eat in silence with the brothers, and he secured two simple rooms for us in the guesthouse. Bill and I used the sat-phone to call our wives and tell them we wouldn't be back to toast in the new year as planned. A New Year's Eve To Remember]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[After dinner, we followed Kyr and a half-dozen other guests into the small octagonal, adobe chapel. As a wood stove roared, candles flickered and incense smoldered, the brothers chanted Latin liturgy during the final hours of 2008. Outside in the frigid air, the starlight illuminated the walls of the great, brooding Chama River canyon.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[After the service, we hiked in the snow down to the guesthouse -- my sandaled feet nearly numb -- and stayed up with Kyr until the wee hours, talking by lantern light about war and peace and music and religion. It was, without a doubt, the greatest New Year's Eve we had ever experienced.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Fast forward to October 2009, when Kyr invited Bill and me to hear one of his compositions performed in Austin by the Grammy-nominated chamber chorus, Conspirare. Inside the soaring nave of a Catholic church, they sang his new environmental oratorio, A Time for Life, which was so beautiful that it moved me to tears. When Kyr returned to Austin early last summer, I asked him, over breakfast, if I could accompany him to the monastery and do a radio story about how he creates music.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[None of this would have happened if we hadn't set off into the high desert totally unprepared for winter weather. Initially, we cursed our foolishness. Then we counted our blessings. There is a lesson for life there somewhere.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[(In a future post, John Burnett describes his recent visit with Kyr, who was composing music at the monastery this past summer.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Members of the Army's 1st Battalion,  17th Infantry Regiment returned home to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., this summer after  a yearlong deployment to Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. During its deployment, the  battalion suffered some of the highest casualties of the war. NPR’s  Tom Bowman and Graham Smith reported  on the death of two soldiers in a roadside bomb attack last fall.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Commentator Georgie Hanlin is a writer and a teacher in Tacoma, Wash. She is married to Capt. Max Hanlin, a  company commander with the Battalion. He has been deployed six times, to both  Iraq and Afghanistan.  They were reunited in July.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[I stood in the packed  gymnasium, in a crowd of anxious spouses, children and relatives. There were  "Welcome Home" banners on the walls, flags on the strollers and "We Missed You"  signs ready to be waved the second the soldiers walked into the room. Little  girls in red, white and blue tutus were running around with youngsters who had  American flags painted on their cheeks, all of them eagerly awaiting their  soldiers’ return.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[I was  still overcome by the relief I felt when I knew my husband had left combat. Now,  on a large screen, I saw his plane land and the soldiers descend.  Some looked  tired, others wore enormous smiles. I wondered how I would find my husband among the almost 300 uniforms returning that night. Once they were officially welcomed home by the  post's general, they broke out of formation and charged the crowd. I watched  many other happy reunions en route to my own. During a year separated by war,  this moment was what had kept many of us going -- both soldiers and spouses. My  husband looked younger, perhaps because he was thinner. I laughed to myself,  because I feel like I aged 20 years while he was  away.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Whenever  my husband returns from overseas, at the beginning, it’s like we’re on an  awkward first date. We’ll start talking to each other at the exact same time. We  try to catch up on a year’s worth of happenings that the rushed phone calls  never quite covered. Then, after a little while, all feels normal  again.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[This  time, I reintroduced our son to his father. The last time my husband held him,  he was just a baby. Now he’s a toddler who refers to himself as a "big boy,"  and my husband marvels at how much he has grown.  It’s both sweet and  heartbreaking at the same time.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[After four  years as an Army wife during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom, I haven’t found that it gets easier. There’s always worry because of  the danger and loneliness from the separation, along with many other complex  emotions. That evening at the gym, I was told there were Gold Star families in  the crowd -- families who had lost their soldiers in combat. I wondered, if my  husband had been killed, would I have been brave enough to greet the soldiers  with whom he was supposed to return?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[A soldier’s  spouse never loses sight of life’s fragility. Even after the deployments end,  you look at things differently. The complexities of war are part of you now.  That can be excruciatingly difficult sometimes. But it also gives you  perspective. And strength.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In response to a recent book called China Is Unhappy, Eric Weiner, a former reporter for NPR and the author of The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World, has some advice for the country.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Dear China:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[I understand you've been feeling a bit down lately. Maybe I can help. I spent a year traveling the world, looking for the happiest countries. I know you're primarily in the export business, but importing some happiness lessons couldn't hurt.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Here goes:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[1: Cultivate trust. Psychologists have found it is trust that plays a huge role in a nation's happiness.  Something to think about, Communist Party officials, the next time you're tempted to skimp on building earthquake-proof schools or  inspecting baby-formula factories.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[2: Embrace failure. The Icelanders could teach us all a lesson here. As one Icelandic musician told me, "It is better to fail for the right reasons than to succeed for the wrong ones." Lately, of course, Iceland has experienced plenty of failure, of the economic and volcanic varieties, but they seem to have weathered those calamities well. Far better, I think, than nations where failure is viewed as an unredeemable sin.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[3:  Make happiness a policy. Not just in one city but in the entire nation. The tiny Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan has a policy of Gross National Happiness.  Every decision the government makes is preceded by this simple question: Will it make people happier? That question, of course, is not always easy to answer, but it's worth asking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[4: Finally, don't think about happiness too much. Happiness is a byproduct of a life lived well, and so is best tackled covertly. Or, as British philosopher John Stuart Mill counseled: "Happiness should be approached sideways ... like a crab."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[George Clooney is no stranger to big summer blockbusters, but here it is early fall, and he's appearing in a very different kind of film. The American is a bleak and atmospheric art-house thriller that's more of an aesthetic experience than an emotional one. If Robert Bresson, the austere French minimalist, had directed a James Bond film, it might have turned out like this.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Clooney plays Jack, a top-of-the-line American assassin facing a crisis. (If you're a big-deal killing machine, apparently, your life doesn't stay tranquil for long.) Jack is a different, more removed character than audiences are used to seeing Clooney play, a man all but unreachable behind his dark glasses. It's an interior performance that completely avoids the actor's usual high-wattage smile and suave good humor.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Director Anton Corbijn is a former photographer, so every frame of The American is impeccably composed and beautifully shot. This exceptionally high level of craft is satisfying, but it can involve us emotionally for only so long. Schematic tendencies in the script, meanwhile, stop us from caring about this film as much as it cares about itself. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[But if Jack's girlfriend brings some life to his existence -- and to the movie -- don't get your hopes up. For while many of its elements whet our appetite and make the film worth seeing, The American doesn't manage to deliver a fully satisfying meal.

        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Ruled by the militant Islamists of Hamas, the coastal enclave is home to almost 2 million Palestinians, most of whom are unable to leave. Both Egypt and Israel -- Gaza's neighbors -- restrict travel and trade with Gaza. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Recently, Israel has partially eased its economic blockade, which Palestinians call "the siege of Gaza." But 18 months since Israel's war in Gaza -- which devastated the local economy -- there has been limited reconstruction.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The corner shop run by Gaza merchant Anwar Abu al-Qays is bulging with Israeli goods not seen on the shelves here for three years. Items are stacked up to the roof, some precariously, like miniature Towers of Pisa made of packages covered with Hebrew script. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[ Qays says the goods coming from Israel -- chocolate, diet soft drinks, diapers -- are cheap and good quality. "Before, we only got very limited things from Israel. Now, in terms of foodstuffs and household goods, everything is coming in," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[But the siege of Gaza by Israel is far from over, he adds. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Laborers are our main customers, and no one has work or money. So however much I'm selling, it's still not as much as if people had jobs here," he says.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Just a 45-minute drive from the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, with its skyscrapers and resorts, Gaza is a ramshackle collection of villages and cities embraced by the sea like a toothless smile. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[It is only 25 miles long, about 7 miles wide, and extremely crowded. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Everywhere in Gaza there is the constant hum of life -- the rattle of donkey-drawn carts, the roar of motorcycles, the shouts of children playing in the streets. The territory feels like a crumbling, densely packed ship that is slowly sinking under the weight of debris. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Eighteen months after Israel's last major military incursion into Gaza, everything seems cracked or badly pasted back together. Even the few new buildings that have sprung up only serve to make the general air of decay more palpable. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Most Gazans are refugees or their descendants -- Palestinians who were made homeless by the 1948 or 1967 wars. Poverty, isolation, unemployment, lack of services and electricity make their lives almost unbearable. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But there are signs of a new economic heartbeat, albeit a fragile one. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[At a cavernous factory, workers package cookies on an assembly line. Although the factory had been practically shuttered, owner Iyad Telbani now has actually hired more people. "During the siege, it was about 150 employees, and they were only working a few shifts a month. Now there are 250 workers," Telbani says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[He says he needs to be able to sell his goods outside Gaza. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["The fact is that the situation in Gaza won't improve unless they allow factories to export. I used to export 60 percent of my products to the West Bank," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[The Blockade And Its Easing]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[But trade with the West Bank, home to about 2.5 million Palestinians, is cut off, and more than ever Gazans remain dependent on Israeli largess. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Israel began curtailing trade and travel in Gaza after Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. Israel and many Western nations consider Hamas a terrorist organization. In the summer of 2006, after Hamas militants kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit -- who remains in captivity -- the blockade became more restrictive. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[A year later, Hamas seized control of Gaza, expelling members of the rival Fatah movement. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Since then, for three years, Israel has allowed only the most basic humanitarian aid into Gaza. Egypt, a longtime ally of Fatah, also restricted travel and trade. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[But this summer, Israel came under heavy international pressure to ease the blockade after an Israeli military raid on a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza left nine pro-Palestinian activists dead. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["Action like a flotilla certainly is trying to put Israel in a no-win situation," says Danny Ayalon, Israel's deputy foreign minister. Ayalon says Israel has to keep weapons and items that could be used for military fortifications out of Gaza, which is why it retains such tight restrictions on the land and sea borders. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[But he says in an interview with NPR that the punishing three-year ban on most foodstuffs and other commodities was a mistake. "Denying different items or products into Gaza was not effective, hence now we have changed the policy altogether," he says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[In response to a question, Ayalon says the flotilla "expedited" the decision to ease the blockage but that he believes "the decision would have come up anyway."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Rebuilding Still Impossible]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[The opening up of the crossings between Israel and Gaza also has had some unanticipated consequences. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[There are believed to be hundreds of smuggling tunnels crisscrossing the border between Gaza and Egypt. Now, some 60 percent have shut down.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Tunnel owner Abu Jihad says that in the past, everything would come through the tunnels: cars, animals and food. "Now we bring in cement, paint, flooring material -- things to build with," he says.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The Treme Brass Band lives and breathes New Orleans traditions. The band often leads jazz funerals and "second line" street parades. They've been featured on the HBO series Treme and in Spike Lee’s documentaries about Hurricane Katrina.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Late Wednesday nights, you can find the band jamming at a down-home joint in New Orleans called the Candlelight Lounge. It's packed with new TV fans and loyal locals. "They fabulous, they wonderful," says Buster Andrews, 37. "Old Treme neighborhood band been around here all my life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[A funky mix of both seasoned and younger musicians rotate in and out of the band, led by 67-year-old snare drummer Benny Jones, Sr. His band has helped to keep alive a New Orleans brass band tradition that began at the turn of the last century. "Still need somebody to do the traditional music so we can pass that to the younger generation," says Jones. "Somebody got to hold that spot down."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[That includes leading dancers through the streets to mourn and celebrate. The band stays rooted in the customs of an earlier era, such as a dress code. "Sound good, look good," says Jones. "My band always had the black pants, white shirts, ties, coats. That's a New Orleans tradition. What the older bands did years ago."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The Treme Brass Band has been a training ground for other musicians. Sam Williams, who now has his own funk band, says, "If you haven't played with the Treme, [you] don't know what's up."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Cool Uncle Lionel]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Central to the band's popularity is the stylish bass drummer, Lionel Paul Batiste, Sr. "Uncle Lionel," as he's known, is never without his dark sunglasses, hat, two-tone shoes, gold watch and rings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Uncle's the man, know what I'm saying?" says Williams. "Just a real cool daddy. He gets all the women." Batiste enjoys the attention. "I keeps myself up," he says. The debonair 78-year-old gets attention whether he's flirting on the dance floor, grand-marshaling a Mardi Gras parade or just strutting down the streets of the French Quarter. His iconic image now looms over Times Square on a banner for Spike Lee's latest New Orleans documentary.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["It makes me feel real proud I'm getting my recognition," he says from the Backstreet Cultural Museum in Treme. "I always try to put a smile on someone's face."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Batiste grew up dancing on Bourbon Street and playing in kazoo bands. But he's most famous for keeping time with his ragtag, upright bass drum with a cymbal on top. Earlier this year, he lost that drum during a parade.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["The fellow 'sposed to be watching it, he was half drunk," he recalls. Immediately, the word went out over radio station WWOZ.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["When the drum was stolen, we took it very seriously," says DJ George Ingmire. "There were a lot of people very upset about it. When you think of New Orleans, one of the things you think of is the bass drum as a symbol. Forget the steaming bowl of gumbo or the beignets, the cliches. It's Lionel's drum that makes it. Hitting it with a wire coat hanger, that's New Orleans to me." Uncle Lionel's drum turned up within a day. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[He likes to tell the story of his drum during Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke and flooded the streets, he was still at his house in the Treme. "I was watching the water rise and drinking my liquor," he says. "I didn't want to leave, but I'm glad I did. Yeah I'm glad I did."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[True to form, Uncle Lionel evacuated in style. "I used my bass drum and turned it flat. Just paddled my feet," he laughs, remembering how he used his drum as a life raft. "And, of course, I had my liquor on top there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The drum saved him as he paddled to safety. "It's still in good condition,"‘ he says, smiling. "It's still taking that beating."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[I'll Fly Away]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The musicians in the Treme Brass Band lost friends and family, their homes and instruments to the storm. Some lived for a time in Red Cross shelters and toxic FEMA trailers, or with relatives scattered across the country. But many managed to work their way back. And when Spike Lee made his documentary When the Levees Broke, he featured the band leading a jazz funeral for Hurricane Katrina.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Clarinet player Michael White says they paraded and danced through the devastated Lower 9th ward. "You could feel when we were going through the streets undiscovered bodies and remains in some of the houses and the spirit was very strong that day," says White, a professor at Xavier University. "I remember the silence of the loss of people was very powerful and very haunting. "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Five years after Katrina, most of the Treme Brass Band members are back in New Orleans. But Benny Jones isn't finished rebuilding his flooded house. And he says, despite their newfound TV fame, the jazz musicians are still struggling.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["We making money just to survive, pay our bills, keep food on the table for our children, our grandkids," he says. "We surviving pretty good. Ain't like we rich. I'm thinking about trying to go to the Oprah Winfrey Show, take the band there, perform there, tell them we need money."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["Ain't that right," nods Uncle Lionel, with trombonist Eddie N. King, Jr. adding, "Amen on amen."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Five years ago Hurricane Katrina made landfall, setting in motion an epic disaster and sending thousands of people fleeing.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"/>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Houston -- 350 miles east of New Orleans -- was a refuge for many people. The Astrodome became a massive shelter and thousands of families opened their homes, to friends and strangers alike.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"/>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Many New Orleanians have stayed in Houston, while remaining firmly attached to the city they left.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"/>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The Soul Rebels]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[For snare drummer and band leader Lumar Christopher LeBlanc III, life was sweet before the storm.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Oh man, it was a paradise for me especially," LeBlanc says. "Five years ago, prior to Katrina? Oh, I was playing music, taking care of my kids and my wife ... eating good food, enjoying good music, seeing good people."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[There are few things in the world that can spread smiles, boogieness and pure unadulterated joy like a seven-piece New Orleans brass band. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[But Hurricane Katrina drowned the Soul Rebels' instruments, if not the band members, who fled to Houston with their families. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The story of the Soul Rebels casts an interesting light on the plight of Katrina evacuees. Before the storm, Lumar LeBlanc and his band lived regular middle-class lives. He had a day job teaching middle school and at night they played New Orleans and toured some around the country. But after Katrina the nation's arts world came running. Those people not only had money; they bought the band new instruments; they had influence and connections. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["After Katrina, we skyrocketed more, the popularity of Soul Rebels, due to exposure," he says. "The Grammy organization, movie stars, Brad Pitt. They kind of found us."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The Soul Rebels became more well known than they'd ever been and began touring across the country. In fact, LeBlanc doesn't have to teach anymore. And his children liked the schools in Houston; they said they didn't want to go back. His wife got her same job in Houston with the same big hospital corporation she'd worked for in New Orleans. Their insurance company paid off the mortgage in the 9th Ward, but there was no money to raise the ruined house off the ground and rebuild it like FEMA demanded; that would have been an additional $150,000. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Then FEMA said it would help the LeBlancs buy a new house in Houston. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["Don't tell me why, but that's what they offered," Lumar LeBlanc says. "So I obliged with that and that's how I bought my home in Houston." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The house in New Orleans? LeBlanc says it's still a mess: "It's boarded up, it's just a shell. It was a brick home so the outside looks fine."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[And so like tens of thousands of other former New Orleanians, the LeBlanc family will stay in Houston. Lumar LeBlanc drives back to New Orleans every week, carpooling with another band member who also lives in Houston now. And LeBlanc has started a new band here called The Hustlers. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[LeBlanc says it's slow going in Houston. Zydeco's what's popular there, not second-line soul. The Hustlers are trying to change that a little. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA['I Don't Want To Give Up']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[But of course, not everyone has had the happy experience the LeBlanc family has enjoyed. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Three years ago, Lorenthia Richardson was living in a three-bedroom apartment with three other women -- all relatives -- and their 14 children. Twelve of them had come, all crammed together, in a Pontiac Grand Am.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[At the time Richardson was single, no children of her own, a nursing student. When we met her in 2007 she'd just discovered her cousin and her four young children in a Houston homeless shelter. In the living room, her cousin, Donna Rodriguez, fell into Richardson's arms and wept out two years of misery. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[In the ensuing three years, it's been a long hard journey for Richardson and her family. Eventually, the housing money in Houston ran out and they moved to Kansas City to be with other family. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[But three months ago Richardson decided to move back to Texas. A Houston organizer who'd watched her struggle and who admired her spunk found money to help Richardson move into an apartment near a nursing school. She was a 25-year-old with a bright future when she left New Orleans that day, her sporty Grand Am crammed full of misery. But that's over with. Richardson says she's come back to Houston to make a life, for herself. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["I just don't want to lay down and say, 'You know what this didn't work so I'm just going to give up.' I don't want to give up. So when Mr. Linwood Johnson called up and said, 'There's hope and I have helped you to regain housing, do you want it?' I accepted, and that's my goal, I just want to find a job, get back in school and start fresh," she says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["You know they're dying for nurses. And I'm dying to be one." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA['It's Not The Same Here']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Twenty-year-old Felicia Lipp was born and raised in New Orleans. She, her brother, mother and father lived in Vista Park, just down the street from the London Avenue Canal, which broke. The neighborhood went under. Felicia remembers what it was like before the levees broke. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["We would sit in the street and all of the neighborhood moms would talk. And we would play kickball out in the street," she says. "And it's not the same here, everybody kind of keeps to themselves." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[The Lipps live in Katy, Texas, a well-known Houston suburb. The Lipp family decided quickly there was no going back. Five weeks after Katrina, with the help of relatives who lived in Katy, they'd bought the house they now live in. For those who are not from New Orleans, it almost impossible to understand the power and allure of what life could be like there. Stephen Lipps was a successful programming engineer in New Orleans; he's an even more successful programming engineer in Houston. But life is different.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["Oh, today's Mardi Gras! And everybody looks at you and says, 'And that means, what?' And you're like, 'No, that means everything!' And they say, 'No that doesn't mean anything.' And that's always been a strange feeling for me," he says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["You know things couldn't go back to normal, like you felt like something was wrong, you're just kind of stuck and you can't get out of there. And you just have to know the truth, that this is where you have to be and there's no other choice."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[But it's not all just loss. Felicia says that when she got to Katy public schools, she was a high school sophomore; she had to work much harder. And that paid off -- now Felicia's a rising sophomore at Texas Women's University, getting a degree in music. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[For her mother, Nancy Lipp, who left behind her teaching position at New Orleans University, what's she's found in Texas is meaningful, too.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["Little things. I just told everybody I know that I lost all my cookbooks. If you have any you don't need give to me and I have a whole shelf full of them. And it's sweet, it's sweet.  Is this home? I don't know. Yeah. Yes its home, it's home. But I'm being purely pragmatic," she says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[For the evacuees in Houston life goes on, but it will never be the same. The best they can do is now is try bring a little New Orleans to Texas.   [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson -- Hollywood has long had a love affair with real-life gangsters. A few decades ago, there was a crime boss in France who made that kind of impression: Jacques Mesrine, coldblooded, hot-tempered, unashamedly brutal and the wielder of a killer smile. And in the biopic Mesrine: Killer Instinct, he gives his better-known American rivals a run for their cinematic money.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Adapted from a memoir that Mesrine wrote in prison, the film takes him from shooting unarmed rebels in Algiers to robbing banks and kidnapping a wealthy employer in Canada to breaking out of -- and then back into -- a supposedly escape-proof prison. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The filmmakers never even remotely try to make him appealing. But they sure make him seductive. At one point, they have him dancing with a woman who'll soon be his wife -- sexy, slow -- and somehow he's also dancing with the camera. As she melts in his arms, the audience gets caught up in the embrace. Then our antihero returns to his whore, slaughters a pimp and buries a guy alive, and you're left thinking, "Oh, yeah, there's that side of him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Jacques Mesrine is played by Vincent Cassell, a tall, lanky French star (you've seen him in the Ocean's 11 films, if nowhere else) whose intensity is a lot like that of the young Gerard Depardieu. That comparison occurs to me because Depardieu is in the picture, playing a gentlemanly older thug who takes Mesrine under his wing and tries to show him how to keep violence and his domestic life separate. Long story short: It doesn't work. The violence escalates even as Mesrine becomes a father, and escalates even more when he meets a prostitute who says she's up for anything, and becomes a Bonnie to his Clyde.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The real Mesrine was known as a man of a thousand faces, and the film -- or rather films, the second of which arrives in theaters in September -- cover the whole of his criminal career. Director Jean-Francois Richet filmed both installments in one long epic shoot, across nine months and several continents. And though there was some talk about condensing the two parts into a single film for American audiences, wiser heads have prevailed. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Richet and his co-screenwriter (Abdel Raouf Dafri, who also wrote the terrific French gangster film A Prophet, so he's having a good year) make it a point not to glorify their subject, but that doesn't keep Killer Instinct from playing like a classic gangster flick. This is still the upward half of the story arc, remember; he's still hitting his criminal stride.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The fall and the paranoia will come in the next part, when Mesrine becomes Public Enemy Number One. And anyone who sees this half is going to be clamoring to catch that half on opening day. (Recommended)  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It takes a smart brain to invent a spaceship. But putting one in orbit takes a brain with extraordinary social skills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[That's because getting from concept to launchpad takes more than technology -- it takes thousands of people agreeing on a common goal and working together to accomplish it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Humans have succeeded in part because we evolved a brain with a remarkable capacity for this type of complex social interaction. We automatically respond to social cues and facial expressions.  We can look at the world from another person's point of view. We are predisposed to cooperate.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But all these things are so much a part of us, they're easy to take for granted.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Unless you have autism, like Lisa Daxer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Daxer, 27, is a biomedical engineering major at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. And for her, things like reading faces and understanding what's on another person's mind are a struggle.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[When Daxer was in elementary school, it became clear that although she was better than her classmates at reading and math, they were better at social interactions. "I realized that they had friends and I didn't," Daxer says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Autism has made Daxer feel like an outsider, even an alien. "I have a weird brain," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But it's also helped her become something of an expert on the social behavior of people she calls "neurotypical."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Daxer records her observations about neurotypicals in a blog called Reports From a Resident Alien.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[People like Daxer have taught scientists a lot about how typical humans interact socially, says Simon Baron-Cohen, a professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["We didn't really focus on how complex social development is until people with autism pointed out to us that this is something that doesn't always just develop naturally," Baron-Cohen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Most children quickly figure out the importance of making eye contact, how to read facial expressions and social cues, and how to fit into a group.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The Social Behavior Of 'Neurotypicals']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[But Daxer says these things are still very difficult for her. So she has become something of an amateur anthropologist, studying the social behavior of the people around her, the people she calls neurotypicals.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[One of the first things she noticed on campus was that students tend to "clump."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["By default, they socialize," she says. That's true whether they're in a coffee shop, a library or even the anatomy lab, where Daxer once watched a group of young women gossiping as they dissected human hearts.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["You have to actually interfere to stop neurotypicals from socializing," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[This compulsion to socialize is no accident, Baron-Cohen says. "Amongst primates, particularly social primates, it is important to stay within the group," he says. "If we took an evolutionary perspective, that would be for physical survival. A member who becomes separated from the group is at increased risk of predators, to put it bluntly."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[So the humans who survived were predisposed to have what you might call a "social brain."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[It's still with us. Think fraternities, or Facebook.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[And if you want to be part of a group, you must constantly monitor your status with other members, Baron-Cohen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["You're picking up cues about what they might find acceptable or interesting, or unacceptable," he says. "Picking up those cues very early could mean the difference between inclusion and exclusion. If you've done something that might offend somebody or upset somebody, it's good to notice that quickly, so you can fix it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Before they defriend you.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Taboo Topics]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Belonging to a group also means following unwritten rules, like not violating taboos.  Our social brains are really good at learning these rules -- it doesn't take long for most kids realize that you don't just blurt out that someone is fat or old or stupid.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[To Daxer's brain, though, observations like these are just facts. So she had to memorize a list of topics that seemed to offend neurotypicals: "Don't talk about sex. Don't talk about the anatomy lab. Don't talk about surgery.  Don't talk about anything that happens in the bathroom."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[And that list is far from done. Daxer recently figured out that death is off-limits too.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["I hadn't realized that and had been talking about it to my friends until someone, actually the church librarian, mentioned to me that she thought it was a depressing topic to talk about," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Daxer still doesn't really get taboos. She suggests that perhaps these subjects just irritate neurotypicals, the way certain sounds or textures can irritate people with autism.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA["We all avoid different things," she says. "I avoid polyester clothing. They avoid talking about death."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[But there's more to it than that.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Taboos are just one of the vast number of social rules that most of us don't even know we know: Don't stand too close. Don't stare. Take turns.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[But this is just the beginning of what our social brains learn to do.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[Daxer realized this when she was living in a group house with other students, who used to get together to watch the TV show Friends.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA["I think it's a silly show, a very neurotypical show actually," Daxer says. "It's all about relationships. I would watch their faces as they watched the show. They were mirroring the people on the screen, I think."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Her housemates were unconsciously mimicking the smiles, frowns and even some of the gestures of the people onscreen.  That was a revelation, Daxer says, because it's something she doesn't do.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[But it's something most children start doing before age 2, Baron-Cohen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA["They're looking up at people's faces. They're paying attention to people's facial expressions and they're responding," he says. "So if someone looks sad, they will mirror the expression."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[This sort of mirroring is probably the basis for one of the most complex and important social skills: empathy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA[Learning About Empathy]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[The typical human brain has evolved an extraordinary ability to see the world from another person's point of view and to feel what that person is feeling.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[That helped our ancestors get along. It's also one of the reasons that humans, and some other species, care for a member of their group who is injured or sick.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA[Daxer learned a lot about empathy from one of her housemates, a young woman she calls "superneurotypical" because she had such good social skills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA[At the time, Daxer was feeling increasingly depressed and isolated. This woman seemed to understand. "I think she knew that I was hurting and she didn't want me to hurt anymore," Daxer says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[But her depression got worse. Eventually, Daxer ended up in the hospital.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA["She visited me in the mental ward," Daxer says. "In our society, being crazy is considered very, very frightening. You think of TV slasher killers. And this girl, when I had depression, she visited me in the mental ward. That takes courage; that takes friendship; that takes empathy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="48"><![CDATA[Empathy may have evolved from the relationship between parent and child, says Baron-Cohen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="49"><![CDATA["If the parent has empathy, they're going to be able to imagine that the infant might be in pain, or discomfort, or hungry or tired, or in need of affection, a whole range of mental states," he says. "So empathy would have promoted better parenting."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="50"><![CDATA[And the genes involved in empathy would get passed on to the next generation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="51"><![CDATA[Another Key To Human Success]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="52"><![CDATA[But empathy isn't just about raising children and caring for the sick. If you can look at the world from another person's point of view, it's much easier to take on common goals. You can cooperate, which is one of the keys to human success.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="53"><![CDATA[Daxer remembers seeing a remarkable example of cooperation one day at church.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="54"><![CDATA[The pastor asked for help turning the fellowship hall into a dining hall, she says. "And they had that fellowship hall turned from a place with a couple of hundred chairs to a place with a couple dozen tables and tablecloths and place settings and everything in about 15 minutes flat."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="55"><![CDATA[Dozens of people worked together with hardly a word, Daxer says. All it took was a few glances, some body language and a common purpose, she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="56"><![CDATA["You don't see very much of that in other species," Baron-Cohen says. He says humans seem wired to understand that two people can move a log that's much too heavy for one person to carry. "And that's obviously enabled humans to do all kinds of things," he says, "like put up buildings."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="57"><![CDATA[Or send spaceships into orbit.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="58"><![CDATA[An Evolutionary Explanation For Autism]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="59"><![CDATA[Daxer says she sometimes wonders why, from an evolutionary perspective, people with autism are still around.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="60"><![CDATA[And she's come with one possible scenario, involving a caveman named Bob.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="61"><![CDATA["So let's say Caveman Bob invents fire," Daxer says. "But because he's autistic he's too nerdy for the cavewomen, so he doesn't have any children. I mean how is that an advantage when it comes to natural selection?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="62"><![CDATA[It seems like it wouldn't be. But if Bob's discovery gives his tribe an advantage, Daxer says, his relatives will be able to have more children even if he never has any. So Bob's genes, including those involved in autism, will be passed on to future generations.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="63"><![CDATA[That's a plausible explanation, Baron-Cohen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="64"><![CDATA["As tool users we always needed individuals in the group who could invent new tools," he says, "whether we're talking about in the Stone Age -- just flints -- or in the modern age, new computer chips."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="65"><![CDATA[Of course that still doesn't account for autism that is completely disabling, Baron-Cohen says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="66"><![CDATA[Adapting With Autism]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="67"><![CDATA[Daxer says she doesn't want a typical brain. Her autism is part of who she is. She enjoys that her brain loves patterns and facts.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="68"><![CDATA[And she will probably always feel like a bit of an alien, she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="69"><![CDATA[But Daxer has done a lot to adapt. She has made friends and found colleagues who value her scientific work. And she says she has come to appreciate the power of what neurotypicals can do with their social brains.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="70"><![CDATA["I've seen them help people who are hurt," Daxer says. "I've seen them draw together networks of people to make the world better. I've seen them connect different sorts of minds so that we could all communicate and live in a single society. I know you take it for granted, but it's really very amazing to be able to do that."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Mark and Joanne Cleaver faced a decision: buy or rent. In normal times, their decision would have been easy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But these are not normal times.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["We would lose money if we bought now -- even at today's market rates," Joanne says. "Frankly, condo prices would have to go down a good 30 percent more to overcome the negative effect of the transition and transaction cost."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Mark and Joanne sold their home in Milwaukee -- a home they owned for 28 years -- and moved to Chicago. The couple, both in their 50s, relocated for her job. And they decided to rent an apartment overlooking Lake Michigan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["It was a tough decision," Mark says. "You have kind of the emotional baggage of wanting to continue to own a house -- the 'American Dream' theory. The flip side of it is, you kind of get to give up the baggage of all the maintenance cost -- and all the maintenance time that goes along with it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Our front porch collapsed on our Milwaukee house," Joanne adds. "It was, like, $22,000 to replace it, just to get back to having a front porch. That's a lot of money to get hit with just to be able to walk up to your house, your front door."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Mark says that when he writes his rent check every month, he thinks to himself, "This is worth every penny."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["It locks my cost in every month," he says. "I have no surprises. Utilities are included. Parking's included. I write my check, I'm done for the month. It's a wonderful feeling."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[While the Cleavers are enjoying the conveniences of renting -- a staffed pool, a workout room, maintenance workers -- they still haven't ruled out buying again. "We'll continue to go to open houses and take a good look and see if there's something there that really absolutely hits on all those cylinders," Joanne says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[And so far the Cleavers say there is only one downside to renting: "We do miss the ability just to go out into a backyard and grill," Mark says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[But they say it's a compromise they're willing to make.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["And when winter comes, and I'm watching everyone else doing their snow shoveling and snow plowing," says Mark, "I'm going to be smiling."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Bill Savory was a Harvard dropout. He was also a piano player, an avid music fan and a brilliant audio engineer.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[And in 1935, he was hired by a New York "transcription service" -- in an era before audiotape -- to record live radio broadcasts onto acetate or aluminum discs for clients who wanted copies of programs. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["So he spent his day recording Lux soap [sponsored radio programs], and soap operas, and news items," says jazz historian Loren Schoenberg, director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. "And in the evening, he would stick around and record, for his own edification, hours and hours of the great jazz that was coming over the air."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But unlike many other airchecks from the era, Savory's were made in a studio. He had lines coming directly from the radio networks, and recorded them on professional equipment.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["One of the items that we have to share is this jam session that was done in the studio late 1938, with Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, Jack Teagarden," Schoenberg says. "Now, this broadcast was recorded off the air by someone else and came out on a variety of bootleg discs over the years. So we know what the music sounds like in poor quality.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Now, thanks to the Bill Savory version, we get to hear it almost as though we're in the studio. The pickup on the piano is phenomenal."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The National Jazz Museum in Harlem announced this week the acquisition of Savory's collection of radio broadcasts from the late 1930s. It's an extraordinary archive of swing-era jazz. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Schoenberg describes the discovery of the archive as a collector's dream -- 100 hours of music -- that nobody knew existed. The Savory collection features hundreds of live performances of jazz legends at the heights of their careers. There's Ella Fitzgerald, Teddy Wilson and Duke Ellington; Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway and Fats Waller.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Hidden Amid The Silos]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[In 1952, Savory provided the material for an LP of swing-era Benny Goodman broadcasts from Carnegie Hall. Loren Schoenberg first became aware of Savory's recordings when he went to work for Goodman in 1980.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["So from 1980 until his death in 2004, at least three or four times a year, I called [Savory] on the phone or wrote him letters saying, 'Please, let me come see what you have,' " Schoenberg says. "He never did. And in the collectors' community, we all just assumed that he had a ton of Benny Goodman, and we didn't know what it was."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[This April, while Schoenberg was in Milwaukee running a jazz workshop, he called Savory's son Eugene in Malta, Ill., and arranged to come over to look at his father's collection.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["So I drove down, through a rural setting -- silos and all that kind of stuff," Schoenberg says. "And there was Gene. And there was the living room. And there was these boxes. And I knew immediately, as soon as I looked in the first moldy, mildewed box, that I had hit pay dirt. That this was the mother lode."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[There's Billie Holiday's 1939 rendition of "Strange Fruit," accompanied only by piano. Another extraordinary highlight from the archive is the first live version of saxophonist Coleman Hawkins playing "Body & Soul" -- in a New York nightclub in 1939 -- which is twice the length of the original 78 RPM single that was his smash hit. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Julie Zickefoose is a writer and watercolor painter who lives on an 80-acre wildlife sanctuary in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio. Her latest book is Letters from Eden,  a collection of illuminated essays that move through the seasons. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Every time I plod out to the garden, jaw set, to pull up the nasty old green bean plants that have collapsed on the straw, their yellowed leaves riddled by bean beetles, they surprise me. They’ve set the table with new white blossoms, and they’ve made dinner for me again. And so I stay their execution and decide not to replant -- why start over with a puppy when the old dog still has spring in her step?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[I pick the prickly yellow beetle larvae off the leaves and toss them over the fence; I keep the plants picked clean, weeded and mulched. They look terrible, but they keep us in beans, and that’s all that matters. It’s practically free, gardening, if you don’t count the hours spent weeding and the bales of straw bought to keep the bindweed down. You plant the seed and nurture it for a while and then stand back and let the burgeoning vegetation do the rest. Come late summer, you take a big plastic tote out each time you visit, there’s that much food flooding back into your kitchen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[For the first time ever, I’ve kept the tomatoes tied up in their cages, and I can move among them without the pop and spurt of fruit under my bare feet. After running and before my morning shower, I pick, dripping with sweat, clammy tomato branches anointing my arms and back. My clothes and skin are sharp with the pungent essence of tomato. I listen to the swelling sizzle of cicadas, dodging their bomber flights through the garden; hear the steady hum of crickets and katydids in the meadow, the sputtering zzzz of bumblebees working the blazing zinnias. I kneel to extract a huge tomato -- the size, shape and purplish color of a human kidney -- from a jumble of fragrant stalks in its cage, working it up through the thick leaves. I heft it in my hand, marveling, then pluck a basil leaf and take a bite out of its smooth purple side.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[I grew this tomato from a seed, saved on a paper towel from last summer’s crop. I sit down in the prickly straw to consider this odd and delicious fruit.  It’s the size and shape of the pink Anderson beefsteak from which I gathered its seed. But it’s the oddest color of purple, and the flavor is zingier. A smile spreads across my face as I realize that its other parent must be the little Black Krim tomatoes I grew last summer. I‘d found one in a parti-colored basket of heirloom cherries and saved the seed. In my palm, I’m holding a tomato that’s uniquely my own -- a deep maroon delight, heavy of flesh and sparse of seed, with a more complex, nuttier flavor than its pinkish parent. And it’s heavy with fruit, bundles and bundles of it. Why, I could propagate it; name it anything I want; give it to special friends to grow. This is how it happens, I think; this is how brand-new plant varieties come to be, in the happy accidents and the hum and bumble of bees, in a small Ohio garden, a long way from anywhere.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The appearance of great white sharks in shallow waters off Cape Cod is forcing coastal towns to close some beaches to swimming. But while some swimmers are unhappy, much of the community is excited.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Unlike in movies like Jaws, many residents are welcoming the presence of the great white sharks. They're good for science, and even good for business.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[At Lighthouse Beach on the southeastern corner of Cape Cod, hundreds of beachgoers lie out along the wide expanse of sand. Kids construct sand castles. Teenagers play volleyball. And parents relax with the latest Stieg Larsson novel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But only three little boys are brave enough to venture into the blue-green water, and they only go in waist deep. It's all because of three words: Great. White. Shark.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Two days before, a pilot spotted a 14-foot shark inside Chatham Harbor. And while it's three-quarters of a mile north of the beach, it was close enough for officials to temporarily ban ocean swimming.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[But on the first day officials lifted that ban, Mary-Alice Sarandopolis and her daughter, Margo, were staying on the beach. "No swimming for the little one," Sarandopolis says. "Nope. Or myself. We won't venture out there this summer."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Sarandopolis says the two will pass the time collecting shells. That's it -- they even left their swimsuits at home.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Hours later, longtime summer resident Bob Potter pedals up on his bicycle to a beach overlook. He likes that there are great white sharks here, he says -- but he doesn't like the beach closures. "I think it's a total overreaction by the town officials," Potter says, adding that tourists making a short trip to Chatham are out of luck.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["But for people that live down here and vacation down here regularly, it's just amusing," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[For Greg Skomal, a senior biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, the sharks offer a rare opportunity to conduct much needed research.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["Almost everything we know about white sharks just comes from one of a few sources," he says. "Again, the white shark is an elusive shark -- and in the Atlantic, the white shark is not a species that is easy to find."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Yet for the past two years, the sharks have been regulars, giving Skomal the opportunity to get Sea World-close to the predators. He's part of a team that tagged five great whites with satellite transmitters in 2009, and four more this year.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[The headline-making sharks are migrating from Florida to Cape Cod, Skomal says. They spend the majority of their time in waters whose temperature ranges between 59 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The sharks come to the North Atlantic to feed on the 200,000 or so gray seals here. In recent years, the seal population has exploded, turning these waters into a sort of all-you-can-eat Vegas-style buffet for great whites.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[And the arrival of great white sharks has made Skomal a regular on the Discovery Channel. People want to know about the sharks. "I think the fascination with white sharks is tied to the simple fact that every now and then -- and it is a very rare occurrence --but, a white shark bites a person," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Whenever the great white appears in Chatham waters, it's like the movie Jaws -- but in reverse. Instead of fleeing, people are attracted. And Lisa Franz with the Chatham Chamber of Commerce says they are visiting by the busloads.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["Anytime you have people coming to Chatham for any reason, that helps business," Franz says. "And if it brings people to the businesses, it makes the business people happy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[These days, Lighthouse Beach holds an atypical cast of binocular-equipped onlookers wearing bluejeans and hiking boots. They mix with the shirtless -- and are desperate to see a dorsal fin break through the surface.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[With perfect water temperatures and seals by the thousands, it's likely the great whites are here to stay for the summer. And many in Chatham couldn't be happier.  [Copyright 2011 WGBH Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In one of my very first classes in the M.F.A. program at St. Mary's College, a mix of poets, novelists and short story folk like me were asked to share the names of some of our favorite authors. The names Thomas Pynchon, Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver flew around the room until it was my turn to introduce my literary self to my new friends. "I like John Irving," was what I said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[When I looked up, the Pynchon guy was whispering and smile-giggling. Others agreed. The hush was unexpected. J. Irving was a bad answer. I remember clearing my throat and saying, "... and DeLillo ... of course ... Joyce."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[This was my first lit school lesson: Keep it to yourself if Irving is for you. A guilty pleasure if you will. Like Stephen King. According to my literary colleagues, "good fiction" needed to be dense. Like Faulkner dense. But there were two characters named Quentin and one was a girl. That's confusing. Confusion is a part of understanding literature. It is? Oh, yes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The second lesson was the following: if you truly want to learn to write well, you'd best toss your television onto your lawn or give the literary finger to authors who wrote big books that became films and were embraced by the mediocre masses. Oh, come on. The Dead Zone rocked. And what about The World According to Garp? You can't pooh-pooh Garp. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[For all I achieve in fiction, I thank John Irving and Stephen King. These authors are maestros of craft. Their characters live and breathe before, during and after the story ends. I recall a relationship, a torrid love affair with two of Irving's female characters in The Cider House Rules. I wholeheartedly absorbed the notion of texture in landscape and the power of character fragility. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[My guess is there are M.F.A. students sitting in class right now, burying the fact that they've read 12 vampire novels in the past two years. Be truthful, is my advice. Take your sunglasses off inside and tell those people whom you really enjoy reading. And if they smile-giggle and a hush comes over the room, don't do what I did and lie to your classmates. Be proud of the books you've absorbed. Revel in your guilty pleasures. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Foss' mother was a flight attendant back when they were still called stewardesses. Foss says the job has gotten a lot less glamorous since then -- as has flying. Going through security is a pain, meals aren't free, even free peanuts are hard to come by. And good luck trying to find a pillow.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["Sometimes the flight attendant is just the recipient of all the terrible things that have happened throughout the trip, and that's a kind of a tough spot to be in," she says.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[David Castelveter, a spokesman for the airline industry, says full flights and grumpy passengers are nothing new.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Naomi Campbell, the British supermodel, said people are always giving her gifts in the middle of the night.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[That's why she says she wasn't surprised in 1997 when a couple of men knocked on her door after she and a group of people that included Quincy Jones, Mia Farrow, British socialite Jemima Khan and Liberia's then-president Charles Taylor had dinner in Pretoria, South Africa, with that country's then-president Nelson Mandela.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Campbell says the men announced, "A gift for you," then gave her a scruffy pouch with what she calls "a few small, dirty-looking stones." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[They were uncut diamonds. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Taylor is now on trial for war crimes at a U.N. Special Court at The Hague, charged with murder, rape, dragooning child soldiers and massacring civilians in a civil war that was largely financed by dirty-looking stones, often known as "blood diamonds."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Campbell denies the testimony of others, including Farrow, that she later gushed about the diamonds and said they were a gift from Taylor. She told the court this week that she didn't know who Taylor was and didn't think the stones were diamonds, saying, "I am used to seeing diamonds shining in a box."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[At first, I found Campbell's testimony incredible. But my wife assures me that this kind of thing happens all the time. Unidentified men always knock on our door in the middle of the night to put grubby pouches in her hands and say, "A gift for you." My wife opens the pouches in the morning, finds a few grimy stones, and puts them into our fish's bowl. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[When I asked why I haven't heard men banging on our door to give her extravagant gifts, she reminds me that I sleep through sirens, car alarms and the sounds of our children yowling for milk.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["You work so hard, darling," she says. "I didn’t want to disturb you."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[When I told my wife that some of those stones might be fantastically precious uncut diamonds, she said she doesn't want men knocking on our door with uncut diamonds saying, "A gift for you." She wants men showing up who'll say, "I'm here to clean your closets." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[At some point, on a ride on the famously luxurious Blue Train the next day, Naomi Campbell gave at least three of those what she called "dirty-looking pebbles" to the man who ran Nelson Mandela's Children's Fund, who has kept them in a safe until recently turning them over to the court. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Taylor has been on trial for two years. But it took the appearance of a single British celebrity to remind the world of the slaughter of thousands of people in Liberia and Sierra Leone in which Taylor is charged. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[An old photograph from that dinner appeared this week, with Campbell standing between Taylor and Mandela and surrounded by the activist celebrities there. Their smiles prove nothing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[But Taylor wasn't seated at that dinner as a stranger. He was a well-known Libyan-trained professional thug who had served time in a U.S. prison for embezzlement and shot his way to power in Liberia with the campaign slogan, "He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him," which is not as lyrical as, "Yes we can!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Campbell may have been the only person to get a mint on her pillow that night. But every celebrity at that table gave  Taylor the fleeting gift of respectability.   [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It's been nearly two months since Gen. Stanley McChrystal departed Afghanistan under a cloud of controversy. He left behind a hand-picked team of counterinsurgency specialists. Among them is the man McChrystal once called "the finest soldier I have ever known." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Command Sgt. Maj. Mike Hall joined the Army Rangers in 1976 and retired in 2008 -- only to be called back to Afghanistan by McChrystal for one more tour of duty. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[It started with a congratulatory e-mail from Hall to McChrystal after the general was named the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan. In that e-mail message, Hall dropped a provocative name in military circles, and he suggested that the U.S. effort needed a new direction.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["I said congratulations," Hall recalls. "And I said if you're looking for a John Paul Vann, you know, let me know. And he said, 'Are you serious?' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[John Paul Vann was an American lieutenant colonel in Vietnam who later became a senior civilian adviser as the U.S. got deeper into the war. He tried to push the Army away from massive bombardment and toward counterinsurgency against the Viet Cong. Vann died when his helicopter crashed in the jungle. Vann famously said that America had not been fighting the war in Vietnam for 12 years, but for one year 12 times.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Hall told McChrystal that the same applied to Afghanistan.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA['It Wasn't Going Right']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["I asked him, I said, 'What's your strategy?' Because I'd been watching this war for a while, and I knew my opinion was it wasn't going right and we weren't going to be successful," Hall recalls.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[After they talked, Hall took a few days to get the courage to ask his wife if he might interrupt his retirement for another two-year tour in Afghanistan. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[After 32 years of working special operations on five continents, Hall came back to Afghanistan on the condition that things would be different. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[He became the command sergeant major for all NATO forces and began to implement an overhaul of the Afghan strategy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[But just as it got going, and before a surge of 30,000 additional U.S. troops was complete, McChrystal was forced to resign after unflattering comments about the Obama administration by him and his aides were printed in Rolling Stone magazine. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[With McChrystal gone, Hall is finishing his tour early and is set to retire in September -- for good this time. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[An Instant Family]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Hall grew up poor outside Cleveland. Joining the Army seemed like a matter of course.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["My dad left when I was 3 or 4 -- I never really knew him -- then had a couple of stepdaddies. I lived with my grandma for a while. You know, mostly grew up on welfare. But as a kid, you didn't know if you had it good or bad until you really start to look back," Hall says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[When he stopped by a military recruiter's office, right out of high school in 1976, it might have been the U.S. Army's nadir in public opinion and soldier morale, just after the Vietnam War. But for Hall, it was an instant family.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["I walked in there and had the 10 best friends I had in my life. My sergeant showed me how to shine boots, how to sew patches, how to iron. All the things, little things that just said, 'We care,' " he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Hall joined the Rangers, which he believes was the pillar that rebuilt the Army over the following decades, even though many of his teachers had post-traumatic stress disorder. "[They were] broken men from Vietnam, real war heroes. There were a lot of alcohol problems, and we called them crazy. Looking back now, we know it [was] PTSD," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Close To His Troops]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Hall isn't the Hollywood cliche of a drill sergeant, or the Special Forces commando with wraparound shades. He is less than 6 feet tall and smiles more often than not. In his 50s, he seems grandfatherly to many of the young soldiers. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[In the past 13 months in Afghanistan, Hall has spent 250 days traveling outside the NATO headquarters in Kabul, checking on how the policies from the top are playing out on the ground.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[That includes foot patrols. He took part in a recent patrol in Ali Abad, in northern Afghanistan, with a platoon of soldiers living with the Afghan national police, or ANP, at an outpost that came under mortar fire only days before his arrival.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["It's tough on you guys sitting here," he told the soldiers. "You're working with the ANP. They don't speak the language. They don't trust you. You don't trust them."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["Anybody think Afghans are dumb?" he continued. "If you do, you ain't been around them that long. They're extremely smart people. Most people in this country aren't good or bad -- they're survivors. They've been literally at war for 31 years."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Survival means picking the side that's going to win, Hall says, adding that the Afghans can't afford to guess wrong. The American soldiers need to convince them that will be the U.S. and the Kabul government, he says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["When you think you ain't making progress, you are. I've been here every year since this war started and I've watched it. We're doing things different now," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Seeking To Regain The Momentum]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[McChrystal and Hall had given themselves a timeline to turn Afghanistan around. In their commanders' assessment from Afghanistan -- written last year and leaked to The Washington Post -- they included a sober warning: "Failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near term (next 12 months)  risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Twelve months later, Hall stands by that assessment. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA["I can't say the momentum's turned around. I'll say that when that was written in August, I firmly believed the insurgents had the momentum. I don't think the insurgents have the momentum now. I'm not quite sure we have the momentum," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA["To a certain extent, we have the momentum, because right now we are dictating what's going on in this country and they are reacting to it. It's not about the insurgents and it's not about us. It's about what the people of Afghanistan think. The people don't know right now, they're very close to the tipping point on deciding, do we have the resolve to stick this out?" he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Hall expresses the feeling of many inside the military who saw Iraq turn around and now think the same resources are only this summer arriving in Afghanistan. But he's aware that public opinion in the United States now is every bit as tenuous as that of the Afghans. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[The consequences Hall talks about are as much for his soldiers, he says, as for Afghanistan and America. "We just can't do this in vain. You can't tell them it's important and then just quit. I think it'll have close to the same results as what happened to the Army after Vietnam," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[No Good Days In Afghanistan]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[When asked to describe a "good day" in Afghanistan, Hall's voice cracks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA["We just haven't had a good day," he says -- because that would have to be a day without an American or Afghan or NATO soldier losing life or limb. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[But he has had many moments of pride. Most of them involve a soldier not firing his weapon, but using his head. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="39"><![CDATA[On the foot patrol in Ali Abad, a lone driver approached the village. Suicide bombers are often single men in cars, but instead of treating the man with hostility, the platoon confirmed he was a local and let the man enter. A confrontation would have defeated the entire point of reaching out to the villagers, says Hall.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA["It wasn't charging a machine gun bunker, but it was a life or death decision that soldier and that sergeant just made," Hall says. "I couldn't have been prouder if he had been charging a machine gun bunker, because hopefully the way he treated that whole village means he won't have to charge a machine gun bunker. That's our strategy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA[When he says "our strategy," it's hard not to think that Hall is including the absent McChrystal. Hall took a trip back to Washington this summer for McChrystal's retirement ceremony, but the two men have not spoken about the incident that prompted the general's early departure from Afghanistan and a long military career.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA["What do you say to each other? I think what it is was, that the mission was more important than him. But he just wrote the check for everybody, and said, I got it, I'm out of here. He could have fought it, he could have refuted all those things, and made excuses. I think the president said the same thing: The mission is more important that one man," Hall says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA["But the sad part is that the way he's portrayed in the article was just not Gen. McChrystal. There's no man who has more integrity and more loyalty," he adds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="44"><![CDATA[Hall, after achieving the highest noncommissioned rank in the Army, will retire this time for good on Sept. 1 and return to Tennessee to watch how the history of this war unfolds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="45"><![CDATA["I'm very much a realist; I'm not an optimist. I've got too many friends in Arlington [National Cemetery] and too many friends with missing arms and legs and brains and souls over this and I know it's important," Hall says. "But I think it is different now, I think it can be turned around."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[A young man's outrage  at a crime against his sister has made its way from the local news, around the  internet and onto the pop charts. The "Bed Intruder Song" started with a news  report about an attempted rape in Huntsville, Ala.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Kenyatta Cheese tracks  internet memes at Know Your Meme. Watching the video, he says, "The reporter's very very straight-laced. You can tell she's just doing her job." Kelly Dodson was asleep with her little girl inside their apartment when, she says, "I was attacked by some idiot."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The camera pans around  the apartment -- there's broken glass, the bed is stripped. It's a pretty grim  scene. Then, something totally unexpected happens.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Dodson's brother Antoine Dodson pops  out of the screen. You can't take your eyes off him. He doesn't seem like a  victim of a crime, he seems like an improbable star of a show. He waves his  finger in the camera's face.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["He's climbing in your windows, he's snatching your people up trying to rape them," he says. "So you need to hide your kids, hide your wife, hide your husband because they raping everybody out here."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"/>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Cheese describes Dodson this way: "He is the most charismatic, just, effervescent, elusive man. He's upset."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The camera cuts back to Dodson after the reporter, Elizabeth Gentle of WAFF in Huntsville, says crime scene investigators have been collecting evidence hoping to identify the attacker.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["You don't have to come and confess," he says. "We're looking for you. I'm letting you know now. We gon' find you. And you can run and tell that. Homeboy!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[WAFF posted the news  report online. And the video instantly began a madcap tour of the  internet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The Gregory Brothers,  who make Auto-Tune The News, got hold of it. They turn TV news reports into songs by Auto-Tuneing the reporters' and interviewers' voices. Their version of Dodson's appearance on WAFF has been watched more than 8 million times.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[That's not all. "People are taking the Gregory Brothers' video and remixing that," says Cheese. A lot of people are re-recording their own version.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[There's this woman.  And this short guy  with an enormous accordion. This sweet, smiling kid with a  Japanese guitar. And the older and larger bearded  men, not wearing enough clothes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[The Gregory Brothers, of Auto-Tune The News, called Antoine up. He says they said to him, "We wanna take  this bed intruder song and sell it on iTunes."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["And I was like, 'Man, that's cool, that's fun. I like the song," says Dodaon. "Yeah, we should do that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[In the week that the "Bed Intruder  Song" has been on i-tunes, more than 11,000 people have bought it. It  traveled to number three on the iTunes chart for R&B singles.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Jason King, a music professor at  NYU, says he's wary of the song's popularity. "It's catchy. It has a really good hook," he says. But it's problematic, too. He says "there's a way in which the aesthetics of black poverty -- the way they talk and they speak and they look -- sort of becomes this fodder for humor without any interest in the context of the conditions in which people actually live."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Dodson himself hasn't forgotten the context of the song. "Some people do take it to be a joke," he says. "I don't, and neither does my sister and neither does my family. It's funny. We laugh at it all the time and listen to the song over and over. But that doesn't change the fact that this was a serious event."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Dodson stands to make some serious  money: from sales of his single -- he and the Gregory Brothers are splitting the  profits -- from T-shirt sales, from commercials. He's got a lot of offers.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[You're counting down the last days of summer and longing for the vacation you didn't take. Or maybe you're already planning for the next. Why not audition a few hot spots with these varied new releases? In these stories -- three novels and two works of nonfiction -- a history teacher, a wry angst-filled teen, a budding celebrity chef, an intrepid spice hunter, and Ernest Hemingway himself whisk you to vacation spots around the world. Under sunny skies in small-town America, Europe, the Caribbean and the Middle East, these characters discover the pleasures of new foods and idyllic landscapes -- and sometimes, they also find themselves. Maybe, in their stories, you will find yourself too.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[By Colson Whitehead, paperback, 352 pages, Anchor, list price: $15.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[First stop: the Hamptons, affectionately dubbed "Out" in Colson Whitehead's coming-of-age tale, Sag Harbor.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Out" of New York City, teenager Benji and his brother spend a mostly parent-free summer getting into low-key mischief with BB guns, fake IDs and beer. The guys while away long afternoons swimming in the bay, lounging on the sand and prowling for the fabled stretch of nude beach. When Benji gets a part-time job in the tourist town's popular ice cream shop, his attention turns to girls -- or rather his inability to attract the attention of girls. His adolescent fumblings make for funny and cringe-inducing moments. Who knew your elbow could be an erogenous zone?]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[But the heart of this laugh-out-loud story takes you not just to a suburban summer idyll but to back in the day of mix tapes, Members Only jackets and the New Coke debacle -- the decidedly 1980s world of Benji and his crew. Whitehead has crafted a witty and nostalgic tale about a summer beach vacation that plays out like one that each of us may remember: You know, the one when you landed your first kiss, or maybe experienced your first summer love. And you learned that even though your grand plan of summer reinvention didn't pan out, still your summer vacation changed you for the better somehow. (Read an excerpt from the book's first chapter, in which Benji describes his family and his love for the hottest season: "There was summer, and then there was the rest of the time.")]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The Hundred-Foot Journey]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[By Richard C. Morais, hardcover, 256 pages, Scribner, list price: $23 ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[In this delicious fairy-tale-like read, our young hero, Hassan Haji, journeys to the picturesque French countryside where he begins his quest to become an international celebrity chef. But first, author Robert Morais introduces us to the scents and sounds of Mumbai, where the Muslim Hassan -- born in an apartment above the family's popular roadside restaurant -- gets his first cooking lessons. Dishes like spicy fish curry and chicken tandoori with hints of cinnamon and cardamom seem destined to become the staples of his bourgeoning culinary skills. But then on one unforgettable day, Hassan's mother introduces him to fine French cuisine. Hassan knows then that his tastes have been forever altered.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Tragedy soon befalls the Hajis when extremists burn the family restaurant to the ground. Hassan's family flees first to London, and not long thereafter, the family becomes the newest transplants in a small, enchanting town in the French Alps.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[It is there that Hassan -- like the rat turned chef in the film Ratatouille -- begins his journey to star chefdom. As the young chef's talents develop under the tutelage of his one-time competitor chef Madame Mallory, Morais treats the reader to wonderful literary food porn with mouthwatering descriptions of pork roasts basted in lemon juice and cognac and cucumber-and-sour-cream salad dashed with lingonberries. Ultimately, Hassan's ambition is city-bound and he travels to Paris, where he seeks to realize his dream of heading a three-star Michelin restaurant. The Hundred-Foot Journey is an enjoyable read, well worth every step of the journey from the kitchens of India to the kitchens of France. (Hassan describes how his culinary life "starts way back with my grand-father's great hunger" in this excerpt.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[ The Spice Necklace]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[By Ann Vanderhoof, hardcover, 480 pages, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, list price: $25]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Ann Vanderhoof's The Spice Necklace documents a woman's delightful months-long journey to the heart of a new culture through food.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Vanderhoof, along with her husband, sets sail to the Caribbean in search of spices and, as a result, finds a real spice for life among new friends and acquaintances who teach the couple how to live at a sweet, slower island pace.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[The couple travels by a boat -- tellingly named Receta (which means "recipe") -- visiting more than a dozen islands including Grenada, Trinidad, St. Martin and St. Lucia. The two spend their days market shopping, fishing, cooking, eating and most of all celebrating each island's specialties.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Vanderhoof gives her narrative's center stage to the colorful cooks and animated guides who are the book's most vivid characters. They generously introduce the pair to the heart of island life with adventures of crayfish hunting and diving for conch in deep waters.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[A warning: Don't read this book when you're hungry. Your stomach will surely start to rumble.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Luckily, Vanderhoof ends each chapter with recipes to satisfy your cravings. You'll find some 12 dozen recipes for everything from a moonshine punch to creamed callaloo.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[The Spice Necklace is a delightful food adventure memoir that just may persuade you to cruise the islands or to the nearest place you can find an authentic Caribbean meal. (In the book's preface, Vanderhoof explains why she and her husband, Steve, took a "two-year midlife break" to sail around the Caribbean -- and why they decided they had to return.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[The Lovers]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[By Vendela Vida, hardcover, 240 pages, Ecco, list price: $23.99]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[On her wedding anniversary, the recently widowed Yvonne travels solo to a beautiful coastal town in Turkey, where she honeymooned with her husband 28 years ago. Still numb from her husband's unexpected death, Yvonne hopes to bask in the memory of their newlywed days.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[When she befriends a young Turkish boy who sells shells on the beach, Yvonne begins to see and feel beyond her own hurt and the pain of her immediate past. Without a common language, Yvonne and the boy speak through gestures and shared smiles. It's through this blossoming friendship that Yvonne slowly realizes that it's not just her husband's ghost that haunts her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Like Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking, Vida tackles questions about grief and identity. The stunning Turkish beach, the almost mystical ancient ruins, and the country's labyrinthine village streets set the perfect stage for her character's catharsis. You can't help but be transported by Vida's melancholy story, a complex psychological portrait of grief and healing. (Read the scene in which Yvonne arrives in Dalaman, the small town, and learns that "thank you" in Turkish sounds like "tea and sugar.")]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Picturing Hemingway's Michigan]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[By Michael R. Federspiel, hardcover, 200 pages, Wayne State University Press, list price: $39.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[In Picturing Hemingway's Michigan, Michael Federspiel takes us on a tour of the lush region "Up North" where the young Ernest Hemingway's imagination bloomed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[In this hybrid coffee table/literary history book, Federspiel provides a rich history of the Lake area that first developed as a vacation destination in the late 1800s and served as the Hemingway family's summer getaway for many years starting when Hemingway was just 6 weeks old. With gorgeous illustrations, photographs, documents and brief narrative accounts from Hemingway's childhood scrapbooks, Federspiel offers a wonderful portrait of the area through Hemingway's eyes. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[The most compelling part of the book is Federspiel's juxtapositions of the "Michigan passages" from Hemingway's writing and the snapshots of an incredibly handsome Hemingway from his youthful summer days.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Federspiel expertly pairs Hemingway's vacation snapshots with vivid passages from The Nick Adams Stories and A Moveable Feast that seem to spell out in words what you see in the photographs. It's startlingly clear how ingrained those vacations were on the writer who found the long days of fishing, swimming and hunting restorative in the summer and again when he returned from the war.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[Picturing Hemingway's Michigan is a satisfying read and a fascinating insight into a great writer's process from memory to imagination to the written page.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA[Now if only we could all vacation the way Hemingway did -- where each vacation not only revitalizes us, but also inspires us to create something great. (Read about Hemingway's connection to Michigan, which began "when his parents first brought their six-week-old son there for three days in September 1899.")

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[It's been nearly four years since Cuba's Fidel Castro turned over the island's leadership to his younger brother Raul and withdrew from public view after undergoing emergency surgery. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Now he's back, making almost daily appearances on Cuban TV, and still throwing political curveballs. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Castro, who turns 84 on Friday, is certain that U.S. and Israeli tensions with Iran are driving the world toward nuclear war. He wants everyone to know it, so he has been talking about the subject all over town, even during a recent visit to the Havana aquarium. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, he convened a special session of Cuba's parliament, urging President Obama to stave off Armageddon. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Obama won't give the order to attack if we persuade him not to," Castro said. "A lot of people are with us in the effort. We're here to make our contribution."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Castro walked onstage with the help of an aide, but he was expressive and alert when he spoke, banging the lectern for emphasis and animating his ideas with his huge hands. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The 11-minute speech was uncharacteristically short, and in the question period that followed, he referred to the Russians as "Soviets" and called their country the "USSR."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[But for the most part, he seemed sharp for a man of his age. He even got in a few licks against old foes in Washington that he has long outlived.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["What's going to happen to this world?" Castro asked rhetorically. "The empire is coming to an end. And making war is no longer a way for the empire to sustain itself."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["At least Obama isn't Nixon, who was a cynic," he added. "Because the United States has had presidents who were either cynics or ignorant fools, like Reagan."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The delegates in the vast assembly hall mostly took turns praising Castro's return and his improved health. Like many Cubans, they seemed to treat him as a grandfatherly figure, cheering him on and smiling through his grim warnings of apocalypse. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The Castro family has Cuba-watchers puzzled these days, wondering which brother is really calling the shots. So far, Fidel has avoided commenting on the island's domestic concerns, holding forth instead on foreign affairs such as global warming, the Obama presidency and now atomic warfare. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Miriam Leiva is a former Cuban diplomat who is now a dissident writer and activist in Havana. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["He has determined the lives of Cubans and all that is going on in Cuba for almost 50 years, so he can't be away from that. And it's incredible what he's using. He wants to preserve humanity from a third world war. And in 1962, Fidel Castro put the world on the verge of a third world war," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Unlike Leiva, most Cubans today were born after the Cuban missile crisis, and Castro rule is all they know. She thinks most Cubans are wary of Fidel's return, concerned that he'll further delay his brother's slow-moving economic reforms. As usual, though, it's hard to gauge how Cubans really feel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[On summer nights, entire families come to Havana's Malecon seawall to drink rum, hear music and escape their sweltering apartments. Few care to talk about politics. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[But Ramon Gonzalez, an electrical engineer, says seeing Castro on TV again just seemed like a return to normalcy.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Gonzalez says that even though Cubans haven't seen Castro in years, he is doing the same things he did before -- only now, he is supposedly no longer running the country. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["Castro's getting back the same influence he used to have," Gonzales says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Castro has also re-emerged in time to do some book promotion. His 833-page memoir, The Strategic Victory, is coming out this month. It chronicles his childhood and his rebel army's rise to power in the late 1950s -- and he is already working on a second volume.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Germany's picturesque Mosel River Valley has been a prime wine-growing region since the Romans first planted there. Blessed with abundant rain and sunshine, a long growing season and rich soil, the Mosel produces some of the finest Riesling wines in the world. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[That's one reason a massive bridge and highway under construction across the Mosel River in southwest Germany has fiercely divided winemakers and locals alike. Some wine producers opposed to the project are now turning to their international customers and world-renowned wine critics to try to stop the project. But the bridge has its supporters, too.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA['A Very, Very Monstrous Big Bridge']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Fourth-generation winemaker Katharina Prum sits in a stately living room in her family's stone manor house, which, like her family's vineyards, hugs the steep banks of the Mosel. Oil portraits of her great-grandparents -- looking stern and intense -- hang on either side of a window that looks out on vineyards first worked by those ancestors more than 200 years ago.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[She sees the bridge and roadway project as the biggest threat since the great late-19th century phylloxera insect epidemic that ravaged European vineyards. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[It is "a very, very monstrous big bridge that is more than 160 meters  [500 feet] high -- higher than the Cologne cathedral -- and more than a mile long. It is a monster in this valley," Prum says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The 31-year-old lawyer, who runs the winery with her father, says she isn't a wine snob worried about the view. She fears that the sprawling bridge will not only spoil the beauty of what some call Germany's Napa Valley but also damage the vineyards' natural watering system. A forested area at the top of the vineyards slowly drains water down the steep slopes like someone steadily wringing out a small sponge. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["There was never an attack like this one. There has been a wine culture [for] about 2,000 years. You find pressing rooms from Roman times. And this area has been protected by all the generations which have lived here in the past 2,000 years and more. ... This is a kind of attack [on] the region," she says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The road bridge was originally conceived more than 40 years ago as a way to connect two American and NATO air bases. Prum calls the project a Cold War relic that -- like the conflict itself -- needs to be scrapped. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Now Prum and some other Mosel Valley producers are turning to their wines' international fans for help. They've enlisted high-profile international wine critics Hugh Johnson, Jancis Robinson and Stuart Pigott in their fight.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The wine experts have denounced the bridge project as an abomination. Johnson called it "idiocy and a crime." A campaign called "A Bridge Too Far" just started in major U.K. supermarkets. The largest-selling German Riesling there will carry a neck-holder label urging drinkers to help stop the highway. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[But the proponents are becoming more vocal as well.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Embracing The Giant Bridge]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[In the quiet village of Uerzig on the banks of the Mosel, winemaker Robert Eymael ducks into one of his estate's cellars. The musty cavern was built in the 12th century by Cistercian monks who were evidently diminutive and liked to make and drink wine. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Eymael is quick with a smile and wears a let's-visit-the-tasting-room sparkle. The monks were short "and fat," he quips. Like the Prum family just down the river, the Eymaels have been making world-class wine in the area for more than 200 years. German oak wine barrels the size of Volkswagens sit chained to the floor, in case they get the idea of floating away during the annual Mosel River flooding season. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Eymael has now embraced the giant bridge and roadway where others see disaster. Once opposed to it, today he says the bridge is "like a 747 on the runway about to take off, so just get out of the way." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Eymael sees the smaller towns along the Mosel, such as Uerzig, slowly dying. New families are not moving there. Gorgeous old slate homes sit empty and unsold. Fewer and fewer tourists spend the night. The big bridge, he says, will help reinvigorate the area. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["Many critics, they are sitting in London or in San Francisco or in New York and they really don't know the problems of population we have here," Eymael says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["You know, we can die in beauty, if you like that. But we want to live. And we want to have good roads and good streets to the places where people can work," Eymael says. "We live here in the end of the world and therefore it's important for us that the world comes to us."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I'm sure people will come and look in wonder at the bridge," he adds cheerfully, "like how people gaze at the beautiful bridges of Istanbul." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Nearly Impossible To Stop Wheels Of Bureaucracy]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[This seems zealously hopeful and based on little other than Eymael's natural optimism, just like his frequent assertion that 95 percent of the people there support the bridge project. There has been no opinion poll in the area. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[But many in the valley, at least anecdotally, seem resigned to the project. Vintner Peter Schmidt sells his Riesling and pinot noir wines in the bustling riverside tourist town of Bernkastel-Kues. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["I don't find the bridge attractive to the eye. And I don't think we really need the bridge. Tourists have been coming to the region for the past 60 years, and their numbers are increasing every year, thank goodness. The bridge won't help that. But in Germany, once the wheels of bureaucracy start to grind, it is almost impossible to stop them," Schmidt says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[He may be right: Bulldozers have already started building the highway leading to the bridge. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[One small glimmer of hope for opponents is that the federal transport minister has warned of cuts to road projects in this age of austerity. Yet he has made no mention, so far, of stopping the Mosel Valley project. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[And unique in Germany to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate -- where the bridge is being built -- the regional transport and economy minister is also the minister of wine agriculture.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[When the Garden State's seediest crooks skip bail, it's up to lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter Stephanie Plum to track 'em down. Novelist Janet Evanovich sets her satirical thrillers in Trenton, N.J., a city Evanovich remembers from her youth.  In her best-selling novels, she portrays neighborhoods with strong ethnic identities, a lot of attitude -- and plenty of food.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Plum is a scrappy if somewhat inept bounty hunter, and she'll eat anything, anytime. Evanovich admits she has her heroine's sweet tooth -- and proves it as she surveys the offerings at the Italian Peoples Bakery in Trenton: "There's apricot fingers ... shortbread ... chocolate chip snowballs ... lemon bon bons ... nut crescents ... strawberry linzer tarts."  And, of course, cannolis -- a Trenton specialty.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The Italian Peoples Bakery has been around for four generations in the city's Italian section -- Chambersburg, better known as the "Burg." This bakery inspired the Tasty Pastry shop, where Plum lost her virginity behind the chocolate eclair case with her on-again, off-again cop boyfriend, Joe Morelli.  (Despite her fondness for junk food, Plum's a babe, in a tomboyish kind of way.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Evanovich decided to locate her series about Stephanie Plum in Trenton years ago, when her father was hospitalized nearby. On visits, she'd take walks around the Burg.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["I would just wander for hours, and I just loved this bakery," Evanovich says. "When I was taking a break and I was feeling bad about my dad, I always felt happy in here."  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[She fell in love with the area during that time. The Burg reminded her of the tightknit, blue-collar community where she grew up, in nearby South River. It's the kind of place where people sit on their front porches and know their neighbors. Evanovich wanted that kind of setting in her books -- but the Burg also had that inner-city edge, which was good for plots.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["I thought it had everything that I needed," Evanovich explains. "It was close to crime, but it was kind of a satellite to the crime."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The author -- who looks a little Stephanie-like herself, in sneakers, blue jeans and a pink NASCAR cap -- heads down a side street, lined with tidy duplexes.  She says this is a place where families continue to struggle for the American dream -- though today the Italian and Hungarian immigrants have largely been replaced by immigrants from Guatemala and Costa Rica.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["As with any emerging neighborhood, when you get a group of immigrants, no matter where they come from, there's always a certain amount of pride in their new country, and I think you see that here," Evanovich says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[American flags stick out from several front porches, and the noontime bells of St. Joachim's Catholic Church play "America the Beautiful."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Trenton has places and people you don't find just anywhere.  This city is a little quirky -- perfect for Stephanie and her slapstick adventures.  She has a penchant for accidentally blowing up cars in her pursuit of some sleazy characters.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[In fact, everyone in these books is a character -- her sidekick, Lula, is a flamboyant ex-hooker. Her Grandma Mazur carries a gun.  And, of course, there are the cops.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Joe Juniak, head of the real-life Trenton Police Department's detective bureau, has been friends with Evanovich for years. He wears a black T-shirt and a silver chain with a cross around his neck -- and carries a Glock 40.  He's made frequent appearances in the Stephanie Plum series. First as a cop, then police chief, mayor, congressman -- and even "Emperor of the Universe." It's his reward for guiding the author through the real world of the Trenton Police Department.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[At police headquarters, Juniak passes by the place where a bounty hunter like Stephanie might turn in one of her captures -- or "skips," as they're called.  "We come to the back of the police station here," Juniak explains, "escort the prisoner through this little lobby here and into our little holding cages."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The walls of the holding cages are grease-stained from all the people who've sat here, handcuffed to the benches, over the years.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Juniak says some of the more colorful crooks have ended up in the Stephanie Plum books -- like the bicycle-riding thief they arrested who wore a Nixon mask and carried a shotgun. Or "Lucky Lou," who'll be in an upcoming book.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["He only had one leg," Juniak says. "Broke into a shoe store ... and all the shoe boxes were all around and half of 'em only had the right shoe in there.  So basically all the guys on the street knew about who Lucky Lou was, and he ends up here in our lobby and he goes, 'Well, how did you know it was me?' And you can't make that up."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Evanovich says her goal is just to make her readers smile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["I mean, they don't have to be laughing out loud," she says. "And I don't expect the smile to last all day. But I think of myself as ... the writer who makes people happy for a little while."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Although a lot of people might think that Trenton's good for a few laughs, Evanovich pokes fun fondly.  She says what she loves most about this place is that people don't takes themselves too seriously.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As a librarian and a reader, my goal is always to ferret out (and introduce other readers to) books -- both fiction, poetry, and nonfiction -- that are sometimes not easily found.

        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[By Diana Athill, paperback, 237 pages, W. W. Norton & Company, list price: $14.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Over the past decade or so, Diana Athill has written a series of well-reviewed accounts of her life as an editor and writer in London.  It's hard to see how any inveterate reader wouldn't devour them with joy. Yet each time a new book was published, I wondered anew why her first -- and to my mind, still her best (as much as I've enjoyed the others) -- memoir, Instead of a Letter had never been reprinted. I loved it when I read it in 1962 and lent copies to all my friends until it went out of print, and I sent my last remaining copy to a friend in Australia a few years ago. But now, mirabile dictu, her publisher, W. W. Norton, has remedied this situation and made Instead of a Letter available for a new generation of readers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[I have to admit that I had some misgivings as I opened the new edition to the first page; I worried that it wouldn't live up to my memory of it. (As all re-readers know, this happens frequently.) But to my great relief, I was quickly reassured that the book had not lost any of its appeal for me.  Athill grew up bookish in a large country home outside of London that was owned by her grandparents. When she was 15, she fell passionately in love with a young man, whom she calls Paul, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford and a member of the RAF (Royal Air Force).  When Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, however, Diana knew that nothing would (or could) ever be the same.  Does Paul live? Do they marry? Are they happy together?  Readers of her later memoirs like Stet and Somewhere Towards the End will already know the answers to these questions, but even they, I think, will enjoy this early, sterling example of what a memoir can -- and should -- be. (Read Athill's poignant description of watching her grandmother die slowly, all the while praying fervently that God will not "let her start breathing again.") ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[By Emma Larkin, paperback, 304 pages, Penguin, list price: $15]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[When I was scouring bookstore and library shelves for books to read in preparation for writing my new book, Book Lust To Go: Recommended Reading for Travelers, Vagabonds, and Dreamers, I came across Emma Larkin's fascinating Finding George Orwell in Burma.  I was taken (as many readers before me have been) by her discussion of how Orwell's three best-known novels were a metaphor for most of 20th-century Burmese history. To some Burmese, she tells us, Orwell is known as "the prophet." She goes on to say:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[In Burma there is a joke that Orwell wrote not just one novel about the country, but three: a trilogy comprised of Burmese Days, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"/>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Finding George Orwell in Burma is a lively combination of biography and armchair travel, as Larkin travels to all the places where Orwell lived and worked.  I found the book completely riveting, not least because Burma and its history were pretty much unknown to me. And I realized that in writing, or even talking about a book like this, one cannot avoid making a political statement -- first Larkin, and then I, chose to refer to the country as "Burma," rather than use the name its current military rulers prefer, which is "Myanmar." (Read more about George Orwell's connection to Burma and Emma Larkin's quest to answer a burning question: "Why, after nearly a quarter of a century away from Burma, did he look to the country for inspiration while he lay on his deathbed?") ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The Good Son ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[By Michael Gruber, hardcover, 400 pages, Henry Holt and Co., list price: $26]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[New thrillers cross my desk with sometimes depressingly relentless frequency; good ones, not so often.  Two of the best I've read recently are Michael Gruber's The Good Son and S. J. Bolton's Blood Harvest.  They're both perfect choices for this summer's beach and airplane reading, or end-of-the-summer's-coming-up doldrums.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"/>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[ Gruber's The Good Son is one of those few and far between thrillers that, in addition to providing the requisite thrills, is both complex, intelligent and gives us a fully developed cast of characters.  The protagonist, Theo Bailey, is a Special Operations soldier who decides to take a more or less unauthorized leave from the Army to locate his mother, Jungian psychotherapist Sonia Bailey Laghari, who's disappeared near Kashmir.  Sonia, who'd become a practicing Muslim when she married a Pakistani, was in South Asia to convene a symposium on "Conflict Resolution on the Subcontinent: A Therapeutic Approach" with a group of fellow pacifists.  Ironically -- given the title of the symposium -- she and her fellow participants, who include an American billionaire, a Jesuit priest and a Quaker couple, are kidnapped by terrorists, who may or may not have nuclear weapons at their disposal.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Unless Theo can figure out what's going on and how to foil the terrorists' plans, his mother is doomed: At worst, the terrorists will, indeed, have nuclear devices and use them; at best, Sonia and the rest will die by beheading.   Because you're immediately sucked into the intricate and page-turning plot, this is a good novel to lose yourself in, but readers who are also looking for a thriller with a strong philosophical subtext -- the sort of novel that makes you think about things like families, loyalty, religion and politics -- will find just what they're looking for in Gruber's finest novel to date. (Read the book's mysterious opening, in which our narrator is awakened in the middle of the night by a call from his mother -- who, despite being under a fatwa, is about to jet off to Pakistan.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Blood Harvest ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[By S. J. Bolton, hardcover, 432 pages, Minotaur, list price: $25.99]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Before she published Blood Harvest, S.J. Bolton wrote two mysteries.  The first (Sacrifice) was terrific; the second (Awakening) was even better; and Blood Harvest is, not to put too fine a word on it, outstanding.  First, I should let you know that I generally stay away from books that look too scary, and the typeface of the novel's title on the cover seemed so creepy that it almost dissuaded me from picking up the book.  But since I had so enjoyed the first two, I gave it a shot -- and am I glad I did.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[When the Fletchers, an American family (mother, father, 10-year-old Tom, 6-year-old Joe, and Millie, who's 2), move into a house that overlooks the graveyard in a small, secluded English town, it soon becomes clear that someone or something doesn't really want them there.  Tom's insistence that he's seen someone watching them goes unheeded, an accident (or was it?) puts Millie's life at risk, Joe goes missing, and there's a general feeling of secrecy and fear that's infected Heptonclough like a virus.  Toss into the plot the new vicar, who suspects that something sinister just might be afoot, and a local female psychiatrist who takes on Tom, with his possibly overactive imagination, as a patient, and you have all the ingredients for a top-notch psychological mystery by a novelist who adroitly melds the natural and (possibly) supernatural into a spine-tingling gothic thriller.  Fans of Barbara Vine, Mary Stewart, Daphne DuMaurier and Dorothy Eden shouldn't miss this one.  (Read the novel's chilling beginning, in which a vicar named Harry discovers something disturbing hidden in a child's grave.) ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[By Frank Baker, paperback, 336 pages, Bloomsbury USA, list price: $14]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Frank Baker's Miss Hargreaves is a perfect exemplar of my as yet unnamed proposed new genre (read more about that and help me name that genre here.)  It is, according to the blurb on the back cover, one of the first in "a new library of books from the early twentieth century chosen by readers for readers."  The story is this: Norman Huntley is the sort of young man who has "never lied in order to get out of things, so much as to get into things," a condition that leads his father to warn him to "beware of the Spur of the Moment." However, his father's advice goes unheeded when Norman and his friend Henry, On the Spur of the Moment, and for their own amusement, invent "Miss Constance Hargreaves."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[They imagine her as an elderly poet (there's an example of her work at the end of this paragraph), with a touch of rheumatoid arthritis, who travels everywhere with her harp, her cockatoo, her Bedlington terrier named Sarah and a large hip-bath.  After Norman (all in the spirit of getting into things) writes her a letter, you can imagine his shock when Miss Hargreaves (pronounced Har-graves, rather than with a long e, and she shares some qualities with Mary Poppins, I think) not only quickly replies, but invites herself to come stay with Norman's family for a good long get-reacquainted visit.  And then she arrives, which inevitably complicates Norman's relationship with his family and his girlfriend.  How this deliciously impossible but strangely believable plot (think of it as a Wodehousian fantasy, perhaps) works itself out is a treat to behold.  I can't wait to discover what the Bloomsbury Group has in store next for American readers.  (I have lots of suggestions, though.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="40"><![CDATA[By Guy Gavriel Kay, hardcover, 592 pages, Roc Hardcover, list price: $26.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="41"><![CDATA[Then there's Guy Gavriel Kay's superb Under Heaven.  Like many of his earlier novels (including The Lions of Al-Rassan, The Last Light of the Sun, Sailing to Sarantium and Lord of Emperors), this is historical fiction at its absolute best. It's gorgeously written and, though thoroughly researched, wears its scholarship lightly. Under Heaven is set during the 8th-century Tang Dynasty, one of the most dynamic in China's history (although in the novel the country is called Kitai).  Shen Tai, the son of a general who'd led the Kitai armed forces in its last, devastating war two decades before, decides that he is going to spend the requisite two years of mourning his father's recent death by journeying to the distant battle site and burying the dead from both sides of the battle, all the while living among the still suffering ghosts of the unburied.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="42"><![CDATA[As a result of this seemingly simple decision to honor his father in a nontraditional way, Shen Tai's life is forever altered in ways that couldn't be foreseen.  Here, the turn into fantasy is barely noticeable, because it makes perfect sense in the cultural context, and is both poignant and beautifully described.  For me, though, the best aspects of Kay's novels are always his characters, who are utterly human (and therefore somewhat flawed, with difficult and complicated lives), sympathetic and amazingly real.  They don't always get want they want, or at least not in the way they would wish for; Kay's endings are really never completely happy -- his characters are always marked in some manner by the experiences they've undergone; they always pay a price for the choices they make.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="43"><![CDATA[It's a shame this book will be shelved in the fantasy and science-fiction section of bookstores and libraries, because that inevitably makes it highly unlikely that fans of historical fiction will find it on their own.  (That's a good example of one of the many reasons that I dislike our reliance on genre divisions in describing fiction).  Kay is a best-seller in his native Canada, and one of my life's missions is to have him be just as popular with readers here in the U.S., too.  (Watch an interview I did with him in 2007, and read about Kay's hero, the soldier-poet Tai, as he prepares for a new day -- which he will spend burying casualties of war.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[By Bob Hicok, paperback, 96 pages, University of Pittsburgh Press, list price: $14.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="47"><![CDATA[I kept changing my mind about which of Bob Hicok's books of poetry to include in this list.  Should it be Words for Empty and Words for Full or This Clumsy Living?  I love them both.  I finally decided on Words for Empty and Words for Full, although right up until the last minute I was undecided.  What I most appreciate about Hicok's poetry is its conversational tone and ways he has of turning the world inside out and making me think about it in unexpected ways.  When I'm immersed in reading these poems, I feel as though the poet is talking to me about his own feelings and observations, and something more: the universality, and yet singularity, of those feelings. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="48"><![CDATA[The second section of this book deals with the shocking shootings at Virginia Tech University where Hicok teaches English.  Take a look at "Whimper," which describes -- in one long sentence -- a search for reasons to help explain the tragedy, and ends with this long stanza:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="53"><![CDATA[Whether it's the progression of his musings that results from breaking a coffee carafe to the wars in far-away countries  ("Kinesis"); or a description of a conversation he had with his plumber, in to fix a leaky hot-water heater ("Redoubling Our Efforts"), which includes doubles, Noam Chomsky, and the plumber's son who wants to join the Army; or, perhaps my favorite, "from the history of grade school," (which contains several pie charts); reading Hicok's poetry is often a journey into uncharted waters.  At various times, as I read and re-read these poems, I am filled with happiness at Hicok's language play and humor, impressed by the way he makes language new, and terror at the randomness and unexpectedness of our life. (Read three more of Hicok's poems -- "A primer," "Epithalamium" and "First do no harm.") ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="56"><![CDATA[By Emily St. John Mandel, paperback, 256 pages, Unbridled Books, list price: $14.95]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="57"><![CDATA[I've just discovered Emily St. John Mandel.  I had the good fortune to come across her first novel, Last Night in Montreal, while browsing at my local library.  I was so entranced by it that I immediately headed out to my favorite independent bookstore to buy my own copy.  I knew it belonged with all those other books on my bookshelves that make me happy just knowing that they're there, within easy reach (whether or not I actually re-read them).  And when, shortly thereafter, I read Mandel's brand new second novel, The Singer's Gun, I was wowed by it, too. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="58"/>
        <paragraph num="59"><![CDATA[I've been trying to think of what metaphor to use in order to convey my experience with both these outstanding novels.  To me, reading them was like watching through the lens of a camera as its focus gradually widens from a close -- up shot; with each page the camera pulls farther and farther back, and we see more and more detail about how that initial view (person, event) fits in the larger picture.  Or, alternatively, reading Mandel's books is akin to watching the ripples spread out from the initial "plunk" of a pebble tossed into a pond.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="60"><![CDATA[I am also at a bit of a loss as to how to describe Last Night in Montreal concretely enough to give you a sense of the story, but here goes:  When Lilia -- who has a history of never staying in any one place for more than a few months -- abruptly leaves her lover, Eli, without any explanation, he's determined to find her.  Gradually, through the author's adroit use of flashbacks, the reader comes to understand Lilia's compulsion to flee, to disappear, to always need to be anywhere else than where she is. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="61"><![CDATA[The story is important (and the ending is breathtaking), but the plot details are not -- to me -- the most important aspect of Mandel's novel. For me, that would be the characters and the writing.  Each of the characters -- major and minor -- is wholly alive, three-dimensional in all their complexity, bad choices, general quirkiness and flawed decisions.  I loved how Mandel wove in the subject of Eli's long unfinished doctoral dissertation (on dead and dying languages) into conversations or musings that illuminated the various characters.  Last Night in Montreal is about love, loss, obsession and how we never quite escape the past.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="62"><![CDATA[And the writing simply blew me away.  Here's a rather long quotation from the beginning of Chapter 3, when Eli is falling into despair about Lilia's absence from his life:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="63"><![CDATA[The problem, Eli used to think before he met her, was that he'd never suffered except insofar as everyone does: the stalled trains, the alarm clocks that don't ring when they're supposed to, the agony of being surrounded by other people who all give the impression of being way more prolific and considerably more talented than you are, wet socks in the winter, being alone in any season, the chronic condition of being misunderstood, zippers that break at awkward moments, being unheard and then having to repeat yourself embarrassingly in front of girls you're trying to impress, trying to impress girls and failing, girls who can be seduced but remain unimpressible, girls who can't be seduced and/or turn out to have boyfriends in the morning, girls, being alone, paper grocery bags with falling -- out bottoms, waiting in line at the post office for a half hour and then being snapped at because you don't have the right customs declaration forms to send the birthday gift to your perpetually traveling brother, waiting in line anywhere, phone calls from a disapproving mother who doesn't understand, the crowd of overeducated friends who understand too much and can't resist bringing up long -- dead philosophers and/or quantum physics over an otherwise perfectly civilized morning coffee, girls, an overall lack of direction and meaning as evidenced in your inability to either finish the thesis, abandon the current thesis and write a different thesis altogether, finish the different thesis, or heroically give up the whole thing completely and go to work at a gas station somewhere upstate, stepping in things on the sidewalk, lost buttons, most kinds of rain, standing in line at the grocery store behind the lady who just knows there's a coupon in here somewhere, girls, and the sense that all of this adds up to a life that's ultimately pretty shallow and doesn't really mean that much, particularly in comparison to his older brother saving children in Africa.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="64"/>
        <paragraph num="65"><![CDATA[Goodness, what a great sentence.  I can just see Mandel sitting at a desk or coffee-shop table writing out this list, and the picture made me smile.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="66"><![CDATA[The Singer's Gun, her second novel, is very different, yet is concerned with similar themes of disappearances and striking out for new lives in new places, all the while questioning how far your loyalty to your family should take you.  The problem with saying any more is that I want you to discover those ripples, that expanding field of vision of the camera, for yourself, and not have it be spoiled by me telling you what's going to happen.  In an oddly paradoxical way, this is a thriller (by definition plot-driven) whose plot details are much less important than the characters and the gorgeous prose. (Read the passage in which Lilia goes out to get the morning paper, then doesn't return -- thus breaking Eli's life "neatly into two parts.")  ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="68"><![CDATA[The Lotus Eaters ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="69"><![CDATA[By Tatjana Soli, hardcover, 400 pages, St. Martin's Press, list price: $24.99]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="70"><![CDATA[Two superb debut novels about the Vietnam War were published earlier this year.  The first, Karl Marlantes' Matterhorn, definitely deserves the wide readership that made it a New York Times best-seller and a library top-circulator. (As I write this, I see that there are 241 holds on 30 copies at the Seattle Public Library; 53 holds on 73 copies at the Cuyahoga County Library System; and 232 holds on 57 copies at the King County Library System, so those readers have a terrific reading experience in store.) ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="71"><![CDATA[The other -- far less well-known, with lower sales numbers, and many fewer copies and fewer holds at libraries around the country -- is Tatjana Soli's The Lotus Eaters.  And that's a shame, because this is -- not to mince words -- a devastatingly awesome novel.  It's one of those books that I didn't want to put down -- I resented everything else that I needed to do in my life, because I didn't want to stop reading it.  In Greek mythology, the lotus-eaters were so addicted to the narcotic properties of the lotus plant that they were unable to live in the real world.  The irony of Soli's title is that what her characters become addicted to is the antithesis of narcotic bliss and lethargy, lassitude and dreaminess: It's not sloth, a dream life, or a being stoned that they crave, but rather the frightening narcotic of war and its attendant dangers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="72"><![CDATA[Without it coursing through their blood, the main characters in Soli's novel are pretty much unable to function.  The novel opens on a scene of chaos: the end (for the U.S.) of the Vietnam War in 1975, marked by American soldiers in helicopters departing Saigon from the roof of the American Embassy, and thousands of South Vietnamese trying desperately to get aboard the choppers before Ho Chi Minh's troops take over the city and the country.  Helen Adams, an American photojournalist, and her lover, Linh, a Vietnamese photographer, are in that group trying to get back to the U.S.  Through a long flashback, Soli describes the previous decade, which includes Helen coming to Vietnam to discover the circumstances of her brother's death in the country, meeting Sam Darrow, the best-known photojournalist of his day, and his assistant, Linh, and her initial bewilderment at Darrow's attitude toward his job before she herself becomes hooked on danger and fear's adrenaline high.  This is not a novel about politics, and it doesn't attempt to be a history of the war.  Instead, it's about people caught up in events much larger than themselves who change in ways that are both welcome or not as a result of those experiences. (Read the book's opening paragraphs, in which Helen tries to help a sobbing young Vietnamese girl she discovers in the street.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="76"><![CDATA[I only recently realized that many of the works of fiction that I most enjoy are those that push genre boundaries.  I especially like fiction that is mostly realistic, but every once in a while zigs confidently into fantasy.  We tend to call such works "magical realism" when they're written by South American or Indian or Latin American writers -- think Jorge Luis Borges' short stories, Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits, or Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children.  But in fact, these great works are being written by authors of all countries. Since the books themselves can be mainstream fiction, mysteries, Westerns or fantasy (or any mixture thereof), I'd love to come up with a one- or two- or possibly three-word label for such works that captures their essence (something other than "unclassifiable"), but so far I've drawn a blank.  Anyone care to help? Have at it -- I'll give you some examples of books that fit what I have in mind -- Miss Hargreaves by Frank Baker, Under Heaven or The Lions of Al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay, and Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke -- and you find the best descriptor.  Okay?  You can send me your suggestions at nancy@nancypearl.com.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In the 1960s--long before MTV and American Idol--the shared musical experience for millions of American TV viewers involved singing along with a chorus of middle-aged men in sweaters. This weekly songfest was presided over by a smiling, goateed conductor named Mitch Miller. Even before the Sing Along With Mitch show, Miller was a powerful force in the record industry, producing records for Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra, and many more.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Born on the 4th of July in Rochester New York, Miller got his start in music taking piano lessons as a child, however a piano teacher with possible hygiene problems discouraged him from continuing lessons. In a 1978 interview, Miller recalled a burst of bad breath as a turning point in his young life.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["This teacher was a very good teacher, but every time she leaned over and said, 'Now Mitchell, you must do it this way…', her breath just bowled me over," said Miller.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Miller heard that Eastman-Kodak founder and local philanthropist George Eastman was donating musical instruments to students in the public schools.  So, Miller decided to ditch the piano and get in line , taking whatever he could get: an oboe. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[He did well by the instrument, studying oboe at the prestigious Eastman School of Music, which led to stints with several orchestras. Miller played under a number of prominent conductors, including Thomas Beecham, Arturo Toscanini, and Igor Stravinsky.  Later, as a member of the CBS Symphony, he helped provide the soundtrack to a Martian invasion, on the legendary 1938 "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[After a decade playing on the radio and doing session work, famed music executive John Hammond tapped Mitch Miller's pop sensibilities for a job at Mercury Records, where Miller produced a string of hit singles for Frankie Laine. Miller described the whip cracking sounds in Laine's hit "Mule Train" to DJ Bill Randle in a 1978 interview.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["We were hitting leather chairs with rulers, and things like that, and nothing worked," said Miller. "They were remodeling the studio, and there were two slats for flooring and I began to hit them together. So, we dubbed it in and in ten minutes we had it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Miller's critics derided his use of production gimmicks, but they couldn't deny how his sense of showmanship appealed to the public.  Miller helped guide the careers of Patti Page, Rosemary Clooney, Tony Bennett... and a 20-year-old crooner from California, named Johnny Mathis. The singer recalls some stylistic advice from Miller.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["I remember very clearly that he said he wanted me to sing so that everybody who listened to me thought that they could sing that way, also --- very simply, straight ahead, no embellishments," said Mathis. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Several years later, Miller was in a bind because a new Mathis album was due, but he had no fresh material.  Ever the marketer, he assembled a collection of songs that Mathis had previously recorded. Johnny's Greatest Hits stayed on the charts for a record ten years. That was the first album to bear the title, "Greatest Hits," and it’s become a dependable sales engine for the music industry ever since.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Sing Alongs For Everyone]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Mitch Miller's biggest impact on American music came in 1958, when he put together a record date with a chorus of male singers who harmonized to nostalgic, popular tunes from half a century earlier.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["The thing was to make them at a tempo that people could sing with," said Miller, "and yet, make them interesting enough that people who didn't sing would want to hear them over and over again."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Miller's first Sing Along With Mitch album shot to the top of the charts.  It was followed by 19 more, and it spawned a hit TV show that also broke barriers. Miller's enthusiasm for 17-year-old black singer Leslie Uggams landed her a feature spot on the program, an appearance that helped break color barriers at a time when that kind of spotlight was rare for a national TV show.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Sesame Street's Bob McGrath, also got his start on the Sing Along With Mitch show.  He recalls that, in many ways, Mitch Miller was a risk taker and a taboo breaker, but McGrath says he could also be rigid and inflexible.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["He kept Rock and Roll out of Columbia Records for longer than anybody there cared to," said McGrath. "He just felt it was not a very musical style. Those were his convictions, and his convictions were very, very strong." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Mitch Miller spent his later years conducting pops programs with most of the major orchestras in the U.S., ending each performance with an audience sing-along. He died Saturday in New York City after a brief illness. He was 99 years old.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[A controversial Army Experience Center in a northeast Philadelphia shopping mall will soon close its doors after a two-year pilot program. With regard to its military outreach efforts, the multimillion-dollar facility has declared "mission accomplished," but opponents question the Army's version of reality. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[At the center, teenage boys sit in a row of Army-green recliners facing flat-screen monitors. They square off in video war games like the popular Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Once visitors register and prove they're 13 years or older, they're given free access to the facility's array of war-themed games. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Army Experience Center spokesman Capt. John Kirchgessner says the center has proved more effective than traditional recruiting methods. Using technology to create a relationship with the public "is a much better way to share our Army story than to simply smile and dial and ask someone if they thought about joining lately," he says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The facility also houses three simulators: Apache and Blackhawk helicopters plus an armored combat Humvee. John Gallato, 18, and three of his 15-year-old friends sit atop the Army vehicle eagerly waiting for their mission to begin.

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The character Audrey Hepburn brought to life in Blake Edwards' 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's captured the imagination of an America on the cusp of the sexual revolution.   But Hepburn's Holly is only a partial interpretation of the Holly that Truman Capote created in his 1958 novella of the same name.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M. -- Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast at Tiffany's and the Dawn of the Modern Woman, writer Sam Wasson shows how Paramount made a Hollywood hit out of a story about a call girl when some magazines deemed it too shocking to serialize.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[One of the first hurdles, Wasson says, was how to handle the sexual orientation of Truman's characters at a time before the sexual revolution.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["One of the things that people forget about Holly in Truman's novel is that she had a bisexual streak and in fact the character of the narrator -- who George Peppard played in the film -- was himself gay," Wasson tells NPR's Jacki Lyden.  "We know for sure that Paramount had a great deal of difficulty translating that aspect of the novel into a mainstream heterosexual romantic comedy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The man in charge of that translation was writer George Axelrod, who had to develop a more conventional romantic interest and storyline for Hepburn's Holly -- something closer to the 1950s romantic comedies where the goal is to get two characters together or married so the movie can end.  A tricky task, considering Capote's original storyline.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["When you're dealing with a call girl, they're already getting together," Wasson says.  "So what's the conflict that you're going to build into the story to actually make it a feature-length film?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Axelrod's solution, Wasson says, was "brilliant."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["If Audrey [Hepburn is] playing a call girl and George Peppard is playing a gigolo, the problem is not a lack of sex; the problem is too much sex -- such that they're so tired by the time they actually do get together that they don't get together," Wasson says.  "You see that in that scene when [Holly] first climbs into bed with [Paul].  They're not sleeping together -- but they're two gigolos -- because it’s the end of a long day's work.  And George [Axelrod] is clever about suggesting all of this.  He can't come right out and say they're gigolos, obviously, but the implication is strong.  And it's because of that that the movie has the conflict that it has and the legs that it does."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[But there are clues that Axelrod was in fact out to create the kind of sophisticated romantic comedy that he had always dreamed of writing.  Take, for example, the scene in which Holly and Paul go to Tiffany's -- Holly's place of retreat and imagination -- to get a Cracker Jack ring engraved.  They hand the ring over to the restrained salesman, played by John McGiver, and a memorable exchange follows:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Salesman: "Do they still really have prizes in Cracker Jack boxes?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Paul: "Oh, yes."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Salesman: "That's nice to know. It gives one a feeling of solidarity, almost of continuity with the past.  That sort of thing."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Holly: "Do you think Tiffany's would really engrave it for us?  I mean, you don't think they would feel it was beneath them or anything like that?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Salesman: "Well, it is rather unusual, Madame, but I think you'll find that Tiffany's is very understanding.  If you will tell me what initials you would like I think we could have something ready for you in the morning."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Holly [to Paul]: "Didn't I tell you this was a lovely place?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[The scene shows an innocent side to Holly -- a character Wasson views as the beginnings of the modern woman because, unlike Scarlett O'Hara or Cleopatra, Holly isn't punished for her sexuality.  She gets away with her man and -- in that little black dress -- she looks good doing it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["She's being rewarded -- that's what the black is all about," Wasson says.  "There were not many young women, girls, who got to wear black in the movies.  You think of Debbie Reynolds, for instance, and most women of this era, [they] were wearing these ... little cute things with bright colors and patterns -- the poodle skirt aspect of femininity.  Yet here's Audrey Hepburn with a slight element of danger coming out of this cab in this sleek sophisticated black gown."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[There's a touch of danger in Holly, Wasson says, "and we love her for it. She makes it OK.  [Holly is] a girl that you can become."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[China has embarked on an ambitious program to streamline its military, cutting manpower and improving technology. But some demobilized soldiers have fallen through the cracks and have taken to the streets to protest lack of jobs, health care and other benefits. It is a seldom-seen aspect of China's military modernization that has the Chinese government worried.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Some of the demobilized soldiers can be found milling around a military complaints office in central Beijing. Some are dressed in fatigues and bedecked with medals. They are mostly veterans of China's civil war, the Korean War and China's 1979 border war against Vietnam. Another group includes members of Unit 8023, a secretive corps in charge of China's nuclear weapons tests, some of whom suffer as a result of exposure to radiation. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Veterans Lack Protections]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[One recent morning at the complaints center, the protesters are cautious and silent, except for a round man with a wispy beard, an unemployed and homeless veteran named Wu Wei. He says the government ignores his pleas for help.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["I treat the Communist Party like my mother and father," Wu howls, "but they make me feel like an orphan. Nobody will listen to reason. The people at the complaints office say, 'Go ahead, complain to whomever you want.' " ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Yang Junqi is a decorated veteran with similar claims. During China's border war against Vietnam, he killed three enemy soldiers, wounded seven, captured one and saved eight of his comrades. He was wounded three times and still suffers from his injuries. He says that if his comrades had not pulled him out of a gully and taken him for medical treatment, he would have died in Vietnam.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[After the war, Yang says he was given a job at the local tax bureau, but he was later sent home. When he asked for an explanation, he was told that he had been granted an early retirement due to illness. Yang said he didn't have any illness and he hadn't applied to retire.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["My friends told me that my employer duped me," Yang says. "They said my employer faked my retirement in order to give my job to one of their friends."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Yang has been protesting his treatment for the past 10 years, traveling to Beijing with a former machine gunner from his hometown who served with him in Vietnam. He says local officials in his native Henan province have ignored instructions from Beijing to restore his job and benefits. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Disabled veterans are like laid-off workers," Yang observes bitterly. "They're a disadvantaged group. The government has issued regulations to protect them, but these regulations are ignored at the local level. Not only are veterans not protected, they are often oppressed."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Protests Largely Hidden, Unreported]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Despite efforts to create a better-equipped, leaner military, China still has 2.3 million men and women in active service and many more already demobilized. It's not that their plight is necessarily worse than that of veterans in other countries. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[But their occasional riots and demonstrations are largely hidden and can't be reported by the Chinese media.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[At a press conference last year, senior Col. Shi Chujing, of the army's General Political Department, said that the government is working on the problem.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["China attaches great importance to the demobilization of the officers and servicemen," he told reporters. "We have put forward a number of preferential policies and measures, and the officers and soldiers who have been discharged are satisfied with the services."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Shi suggested that given the size of China's armed forces and the scale of the reforms, there are bound to be a few disgruntled grunts.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["The individual cases are normal cases during the process of reform and opening up," Shi said. "We are a populous country, and with the deepening of reform and opening up, these kind of issues will be resolved."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Fear That 'Soldiers Will Unite And Organize']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[But Yao Huiquan, a cheerful old soldier in an olive greatcoat, disagrees that the problem is a minor one. He says what officials fear most about protesting veterans is their discipline. Yao has watched the veterans in action.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["They organize according to rank: squad, platoon, company, battalion and regiment," says Yao, a regular at the military complaints office. "Then they go hold sit-ins in front of the Central Military Commission."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Yao says military officials have sought to punish him for his organizing work.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["I've been beaten up twice by agents of the Central Military Commission," Yao says, still smiling. "They fear that we soldiers will unite and organize. There are 10 million of us, and that's no small number, right?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[This year, Communist Party officials warned of three emerging threats to stability: underground labor unions, protesting farmers and dissatisfied veterans. Of course, farmers, workers and soldiers once formed the background of China's communist revolution. Now, officials say protesters among these groups must be suppressed.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Algerian singer Khaled is known as the King of Rai -- a kind of North African music with roots in traditional folklore. Taken literally, rai translates to "opinion," and Khaled has taken this idea to heart in his music, speaking out to his countrymen with a voice that transcends borders. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[He was born Khaled Hadj Brahim in 1960 in the Mediterranean port city of Oran -- or "Crazyville," as he once called it. Oran marks an intersection of cultures, a place where Spanish, Moroccan, French, Arabic, American, Berber, Jewish and gypsy ideas and idioms collided. Khaled came of age during the lull between two bloody conflicts: the 1950s war that freed Algeria from French colonialism; and the religiously fueled civil war of the 1990s. In a land torn apart by intolerance and violence, Khaled stood out as an artist who embraced openness and peace. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Khaled was also a bad boy, a playboy and a partier, even rejecting the polite traditions of Algeria's poetry. When a traditional Oranese poet wants to describe love, Khaled once explained to me, the poet will speak in metaphor -- for example, about a pigeon. Khaled says he prefers to take a different approach.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["When I sing rai," Khaled said, "I talk about things directly: I drink alcohol, I love a woman, I am suffering. I speak to the point."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[A Voice Of Defiance]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Khaled's directness and his force-of-nature voice, which blurs the lines between anguish and ecstasy, made him the darling of Oran's cabarets and wedding parties. It didn't sit so well with the growing number of Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria, though, and his songs were consequently banned from state radio. His voice still made its way into homes and hearts all over the country, thanks to cassette tapes. Later, after performing a concert for 20,000 people in Algiers in 1985, his became the voice of a generation for many. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[In 1989, it became dangerous for Khaled to stay in Algeria, where artists and intellectuals were being killed by fundamentalists. He fled to safety in France. It was outside Paris where I first heard him sing at a gig in 1992. For a man with such a big voice -- robust and burly, reedy and refined -- he seemed surprisingly small. The audience was mostly second-generation North African immigrants, many of whom were wary of potential troublemakers in their midst. But when Khaled took the stage and unleashed his defiant, guttural cry, fear gave way to exuberance and joy. In 1992, "Didi," from his self-titled album, led Khaled to international fame and recognition; he sang it in South Africa at the opening concert for the 2010 World Cup.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Khaled has never really shaken his mischievous image: He's been to court on more than one occasion for domestic disputes, and he's railed publicly against Muslim fundamentalists who he says have "the mentality of the Stone Age." His collaborations with Jewish and American artists have irked even moderate Muslims. Khaled fiercely adheres to his message of peace, love and personal freedom. But in the combative milieu of North Africa and the Middle East, those too can be fighting words.  Regardless, Khaled seems unbothered. He just keeps smiling and singing -- damn the consequences.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Bone marrow transplants are often the only treatment for blood-related cancers. The treatment, however, is dependent on the patient finding a donor who shares a similar genetic makeup. In most cases, that means the match is found in someone of the same race. But the black community has a particularly tough time attracting donors. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Shawn Austin sits in the living room of his home in Brooklyn.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["She's beautiful in that picture," Austin says as he grabs a photo of his wife from on top of the piano. The picture shows an African-American woman with long straight hair, a slender build, and a mischievous smile. That was Shawn's 42-year-old wife last year. In September, Jennifer Jones Austin was diagnosed with leukemia.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["You know my immediate thought was, I am going to lose my wife to cancer," Austin says. But he learned that there was one way to save his wife's life. Through a bone marrow transplant. The transplant would use the bone marrow cells of another person to replace Jennifer's cells. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Siblings have a 25 percent chance of being a match. But Jennifer's siblings weren't a match. So the family turned to the National Marrow Donor Program with hope and optimism.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["We thought it was no big deal. It's a database of eight million plus -- someone's gotta be a match. Well, when you're of color it's not that easy," says Austin.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[In 2008, 40 percent of caucasians who didn't have a bone marrow match in their own family were able to receive a transplant through the national marrow donor program. The rate for African-Americans was 15 percent.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[One reason for the difference is that fewer black people sign up to be donors than white people.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But there is another barrier. Experts say that African-American patients have more rare genetic makeups than caucasians because their genes tend to be more racially mixed. This makes finding a precise match that much tougher.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[When Jennifer Jones Austin couldn't find a match, her family appealed to the public in ads shown in black churches and on the Internet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[In the video, Jones Austin shares her story, "I and my family and my friends have been frantically searching for the last little while for a donor," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Experts say despite emotional pleas, blacks are resistant to donating and 38-year-old Akiim DeShay says he can relate.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["That's a very, very deep issue in the black community and it really stems from having a mistrust of what a lot of African Americans consider the 'system,'" DeShay says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[DeShay says given the way blacks have historically been treated by the health system it's no wonder they aren't rushing to do cheek swabs to have part of their DNA registered with the National Marrow Donor Program.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["I recall I had the same feelings, so I never ever ever gave blood," DeShay says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[But his own attitude changed in 2003 when he learned he needed a bone marrow donor or he would die.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["My thing was, first of all, I don't know these people. They are going to be sticking me with needles. I just can't trust someone to stick me with needles," DeShay says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[His sister's marrow saved his life. Now he spends his time recruiting other African-Americans to sign up through his website blackbonemarrow.com.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[In addition to the mistrust, many fear that being a donor is painful. But thanks to advances in science donating can be relatively pain-free.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[So, cells from umbilical cord that matched Jennifer's genetic makeup were used to save her life, an option with longer recovery times and sometimes the fear that cell supply might not be enough.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Today, her face looks nothing like the photo on the piano. No longer do her long locks frame her face. Instead, just a few strands of tiny hair peek out from her bald head.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["While I may be cured of leukemia, it is a life-long treatment process. I've got to find that place I can be forward-thinking but all the while be mindful of -- that nothing's promised.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Even though Jennifer wasn't able to find a bone marrow donor and had to settle for cord blood, she says she's already heard that of the 12,000 or so donors -- mostly blacks -- who signed up trying to save her life, there ended up being matches for other African-Americans who needed transplants.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[If you're not from Texas and you imagine what it's like, this is the Texas you think of: horses, cattle, rolling grassland that finally meets an endless blue sky at the far horizon. In Goree, Texas -- population about 300 -- there are people who step into a stirrup with the same ease that you press your keyless remote and climb into the car. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Out here, people are scarce. There's the unavoidable knowledge that the past was greater than the present is or the future will ever be. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["I want to be a cowboy sweetheart. I want to learn to rope and ride. I want to ride through the plains and deserts, out west of the great divide," sings 17-year-old Ashley Wheeler before a group of about 40 people, unabashedly. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[There might be a tendency to think, "Well, how much talent could there be out here? There's not that big a pool to begin with." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But, it turns out, it's not just about raw numbers. Dozens of fiddle players, guitar players and singers of all ages come to the Bobby Boatright Memorial Music Camp to learn how to play Western swing. Boatright was a well-known local fiddle player who played with some of the greats. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The Beginning]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Western swing originated in the late 1920s. While the rest of the country was boogieing to big band music or jumping and jiving in jazz halls, country music lovers could square dance -- which was so last century -- but that was about it. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[That is, until Western swing. It was a cross between big band and jazz, a new sound meant to get cowboy boots scootin' across Western dance floors. And it did. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Bobby Boatright died of leukemia 18 months ago, but his Western swing music camp lives on. Johnny Boatright was Bobby's brother, friend and rhythm guitar player. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["We expose the kids to the Western swing songs," Boatright says. "But they can take what they learn here and really apply it to any music in the world. If you're a good Western swing player, you can flat-out play anything."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[The camp is for both children and adults, and, this year, it's about equally divided. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The Campers]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Everyone here, teachers and students, come from nearby small towns -- some of them really small. Munday, Weinert, Knox City, Seymour, Benjamin and Pampa are the bigger towns. Fifteen-year-old Ryder Cude, cowboy hat atop his head, is from the Goree area. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["Normally there's not many people around here, so I usually have to play by myself," he says. "But every now and then, I can find a jam session in Seymour or Knox City where I can go play with some people."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Ryder has been playing for six years and this is his fourth year at the Western swing summer camp. There are three hours of instruction in the morning, three hours in the afternoon, and then, after dinner, a group jam session. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["It's a little tiring sometimes but it's still fun," says Cole Redwine, 10, who has been playing fiddle for just a year. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["The worst part is probably waking up early," Cole says. "And the best part is just doing what I love, playing the fiddle and hanging out with my friends."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Harkening Back To A Different Time]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[When you ask Cole -- or any of the other children here -- why they have any interest in playing a style of music that was popular over half a century ago, the answer almost always involves family. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[From the way they mimic their parents' style of dress and speech to the "yes sirs" and "no ma'ams," playing Western swing is a kind of love letter from younger to older generation, a voicing of solidarity. If this cowboy music and cowboy way of life is slowly fading away, it seems no one here wants it to.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["My dad's side of the family likes it, and my mom's side of the family likes it," Cole says. "My dad likes it a lot too. And I've heard it a lot, and I like it now."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[But nearly half the campers are adults.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["I'm in the cattle business, and I play the fiddle," says Duane Johnson, 69. "And I'm just down here trying to learn a few new tunes."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Johnson grew up dancing to Western swing. Back then, you got dressed up, picked up your date.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["When we were young and before my wife and I married and then after my wife and I were married, we went to rodeo dances and we had square dance clubs and did a lot of dancing," Johnson says. "It was the social thing to do."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA['Rebirth A Town']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[The camp is housed in what used to be the junior high in Goree -- that is until last September, when the school district gave the building and campus back to the town and said, "Good luck." That was a big blow because the junior high was pretty much the only reason anyone still came to Goree. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Tammy Trainham looks out over the school courtyard and smiles. She is the mayor's wife and this is her doing -- she talked them into bringing the fiddle camp here. These five days are all that's left between Goree and oblivion. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA["We're trying to rebirth a town," Trainham says. "It was dead -- graveyard dead."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[And the Bobby Boatright Memorial Music Camp needed a fresh start, too. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[For the first nine years, it had been on a ranch. But the beautiful junior high in Goree -- with its expansive cafeteria, gym and big, window-filled classrooms, not to mention powerful air conditioning and new carpeting -- seemed nice. A new beginning after the death of their namesake. So here they are: School, music camp and town, trying to keep each other -- and Western swing -- going.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Remember when movies announced themselves with fanfares and elaborate opening credits? In the studio era, names were projected onto velvet curtains, or books opened to reveal pages packed with stars and screenwriters. In the 1960s, it was animated art-titles and jazz -- think the Pink Panther leaving paw-prints on the actors' names. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Fast forward to perhaps this decade's defining motion picture event -- Avatar -- and there are no opening credits at all. Not even a title before the action starts.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Credit sequences are becoming something of a lost art in today's cinema. Hot desert sands for Prince of Persia, phallic New York skyscrapers for Sex and the City 2 -- this paltry level of creativity is what we've gotten used to. When a picture -- even one as bad as The Back-up Plan -- does something a little different, you think the film is actually going to be clever. The Back-up Plan is about a woman desperate to get pregnant, and starts with an animated Jennifer Lopez wandering through a city where everything reminds her of babies: streetscapes made of building blocks, a traffic cop whose whistle morphs into a pacifier, and so on. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The sequence swiftly establishes her mind-set without dialogue -- and when the dialogue starts, you understand why that was smart. The idea here was a throwback to those openings from 1950s comedies, where, say, Doris Day and Rock Hudson threw pillows at their own names to wipe them off the screen at the beginning of Pillow Talk.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[This was pure, but artful, mood-setting -- a few seconds to let the audience forget the struggle it had parking and give the movie a bit of a running start. In that respect, the most effective title sequence of this summer -- one of the coolest in years, actually -- is for the thriller Splice, about scientists who add human DNA to a creature they've created from random genetic material in a lab.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[In the opening seconds, sonograms of weird looking creatures morph into the logos for Warner Brothers and its producing partners, and then you're plunged into a bath of bubbling amniotic fluid. Shapes materialize -- nothing identifiable, just fleshy masses. Clotted plant-cell structures form the name of actor Adrian Brody, muscle fibers bulge out to spell the name of his co-star Sarah Polley, and then the camera follows a fleshy tube that looks like an umbilical cord, where fish scales peel off to reveal other names, and finally, veins pulse and darken into the title: Splice.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Then as a heartbeat establishes itself, the camera spots a point of light in the cloudy fluid. The point widens, and through it come forceps and hands, and as you spot the lab coats and doctor's masks, you realize where you've been -- in an artificial womb -- and where the story's going. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[It's spectacular -- the work of French title designer Kook Ewo in collaboration with the film's director – and, at three minutes 18 seconds, took a visual effects company five months to produce. That's longer than it took to shoot the entire film that follows. Which would seem crazy if it was just a list of names, but it's so much more -- a wordless explanation of what the film's scientists will be doing with their gene-splicing. Who needs pages of exposition when it's already clear that adding human DNA to this veggie-fishy-fleshy thing isn't going to be a good idea.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Of course, not every picture should start with a bang. Woody Allen will get no argument from me in September when he begins You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger as he has almost everything he's done since 1975, with white lettering -- Windsor-condensed -- on a black background. My response, I know from experience, will be Pavlovian. Sure he's disappointed me, but I only have to see that typeface accompanied by a little jazz to start smiling. Titles can work wonders. But so can branding.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In Kandahar province, there are two Afghan powerbrokers. One is a warlord; the other is a tribal leader. One is working with the Americans, while the other is far more tentative in his support.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The two men, and their relations with U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan, illustrate a challenge as the military tries to build enduring partnerships to rid the area of Taliban and bring stability to the country.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[A California couple have become the unlikely stars of the family blog world. Harry and Barbara Cooper have a couple of thousand fans on Facebook and thousands more are visiting their website daily -- not bad for two love birds pushing the century mark. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[At the Hollenbeck Palms retirement and nursing home in Los Angeles, they're simply known as Harry and Barbara. He's 98; she's 93. But to their thousands of Internet fans, they're the OGs, short for "original grandparents." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[On their website, Barbara and Harry, married 72 years, espouse charming advice, wisdom and uncensored wit in featured videos like Around the Hood  and restaurant reviews. Ask Grandma Anything is the most popular video blog -- and no subject is off limits.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[In one video, a woman asks: "Hi -- I was just wondering what your position is on lesbians?" Barbara responds: "Just do your thing -- that's all." Harry says: "How do I feel about lesbians? Good luck to them."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Behind the sometimes shaky camera are the couple's granddaughters -- sisters Chinta and Kim Cooper -- who a couple of years ago became the primary caregivers to the aging couple. Kim says visits with their grandparents were hilarious.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["We would just be laughing and going, 'Can you believe what just happened?' And then we would just get back to our lives and be like, 'What was that cute thing she said?' So that was part of the impetus to lock these moments in amber and keep them and share them -- and not lose them," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[It's rare when the small camera does not capture them kissing or holding hands. And it's not surprising most of their fans write in to ask about the secret of a long-lasting love affair. It's a subject they never seem to tire of.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["As long as she's close by -- I'm happy," Harry says. "Cause I'm very amusing," Barbara says. "I have a lot of tales to tell him."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[It's a repartee delivered with show-business timing. When Harry said: "I couldn't keep my eyes off her," Barbara, her speech sometimes slurred by a stroke, quipped: "We didn't trust each other, so we had to keep an eye on each other ... not really, not really."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Kim Cooper smiles up at her grandmother and shakes her head. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I never know what she's going to say," Kim says. "She's like the oracle because she doesn't stop to ponder. She has the answer. It's like she's been waiting for this question all her life."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[As Chinta gets ready behind the camera, Kim shuffles through the Ask Grandma Anything mail. The first letter is from a young woman concerned about her live-in boyfriend.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Kim reads from the letter: "I'm tired of doing his laundry, cleaning up after him ... and have no idea whether he's coming home at 5 p.m. or 5 a.m. Your wisdom please. Thank you."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[From her armchair -- looking directly into the camera -- Barbara doesn't miss a beat. "Pack his suitcase and put it outside the door," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[And what about for a woman considering marriage who's getting cold feet? "Jump in with both feet -- you will not feel sorry," Barbara says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[The couple's biggest fans are the two who know them best, Kim and Chinta Cooper. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["We just sort of go through the world with our grandparents and live -- and it's nice," Chinta says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[And they know these days every moment is to be treasured. After lunch in the cafeteria -- Chinta sat down with her grandmother at the computer to help her answer her fan e-mail. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The great musical-comedy star Marilyn Miller sang the Jerome Kern song "Look for the Silver Lining" in the 1929 movie version of Sally, her first starring Broadway vehicle. It would became her theme song. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Miller often played Cinderella roles: Sally was a waitress and dishwasher who loses her job but ends up starring on Broadway and marrying a millionaire. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Though she died before I was born, Miller was one of the first Broadway celebrities I ever heard about: My mother had seen her on the stage and loved her. When I was little, she used to sing me one of the other Kern songs Miller made famous, "Who?" -- in which a series of questions -- "Who stole my heart away? / Who makes me dream all day?" -- is finally answered by "Who? No one but you!" Being my mom, she would point her finger at my nose. So without ever seeing Marilyn Miller, I loved her too. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Nearly a decade after her death, Miller figured as a major character in a couple of 1940s biopics. One was the sappy Look for the Silver Lining, in which June Haver plays Miller and gangly Ray Bolger steals the picture as her friend and dance partner. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The other was MGM's all-star Till the Clouds Roll By, a fictionalized biography of Jerome Kern, who actually led a relatively uneventful life. The dramatic climax is the tantrum Kern's young niece throws because she's replaced in a show by ... Marilyn Miller -- who's played by Judy Garland. The movie was really an excuse for big production numbers, and Garland was especially memorable singing "Look for the Silver Lining." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Two of Miller's three movies, Sally and Sunny, have just been released on Warner Archives, a new series that has put out some 400 rare or historic titles never before available on DVD. You can see that Miller wasn't a perfect fit for film. For one thing, she sings with a trained, almost operatic voice that seems disconnected from her character's down-to-earth speaking voice. It's a quality designed more for a theater, where vocal projection was more important than it is in film -- where amplified sound and intimate close-ups are more suited to realism than theatrical stylization. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The primitive staging and camera-work with which Broadway musicals were first transferred to the big screen further compromise plausibility. Miller's dancing, though, both tap and toe, comes off better, especially in her comedic numbers, and she's a touching actress. Her bright voice, canny phrasing, endearing smile, and affecting tears can still light up the screen.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Reading about Marilyn Miller, I found several surprising items. The name Marilyn, for example -- Miller made it up from her own given name, Mary, and her mother's name, Lynn -- had apparently been quite rare until Miller's stardom made it one of this country's most popular girl's names. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Decades later, Ben Lyon -- a Twentieth Century Fox executive and former leading man who had co-starred with Miller and W.C. Fields in Miller's last and best movie, Her Majesty, Love -- signed up another pretty blond actress, Norma Jean Baker. She reminded him of Miller, and he urged her to change her name to Marilyn. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Both Marilyns had problems with their marriages and with substance abuse, and both died very young -- Monroe at 36, Miller at 37, from complications of a chronic sinus infection. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Marilyn Monroe's films will always keep her memory alive. Marilyn Miller didn't live far enough into the movie era to appear in films that would do the same for her.          [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Julie Treible caught a common spring cold this year and lost her ability to speak -- for six weeks.  The cold had turned into bronchitis, then laryngitis -- at least that's what she thought.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["April 1 I got a cold, and this part never got better -- my voice," says the 43-year-old single mom in a forced whisper.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Treible communicated with her family using a white board, because trying to talk made her dizzy.  She even passed out once and fell down the stairs, scaring her 10-year-old son and landing her in the hospital.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Not Your Average Frog In The Throat]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Without her full voice, Treible had to stop working her job at the meat counter of a local grocery store because customers couldn't understand her. Her loss of voice affected pretty much every aspect of her life.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I can't talk on the phone, I can't order food at a restaurant because people don't understand me," she says.  "My son had a hockey party, and all the parents were sitting around and nobody talked to me. They just sat there. And I know it's because I can't talk back, but I really didn't feel a part of anything."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Scopes of her throat, CT scans, an MRI and visits to various specialists yielded no answers.  But after an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Head and Neck Institute, she's hopeful that will change.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA['Eeees' And 'Oooos']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Claudio Milstein, a voice specialist, is optimistic he can get Treible speaking again and send her home that day. With Treible seated in a chair, Milstein stands behind her and places his hands on her neck.  He begins by manipulating the muscles in her throat with his fingers. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"/>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I'm going to stretch the muscles around your voice box," he says. A few small pops are audible as he works. "Those cracks, you hear that? Those are normal, so don't be concerned."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Treible remains silent, wincing slightly as Milstein presses against her voice box. He turns her head from side to side and then presses down on her shoulders.  To the casual observer, it looks something like a chair massage.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[ "We're going to start working with your voice now," Milstein says. "We're going to have you make a sound like 'eeee' without strain. OK, so long 'eeees.' "]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Treible lets out a shaky sound in her raspy, strained voice.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[While Milstein works, massaging her shoulders, neck and throat, Treible makes a continuous "e" sound, pausing for breaths, then switching to "oooo."  Within minutes, the raspy whisper begins to disappear.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Milstein asks Treible to say the word "one" over and over.  Treible repeats it back in a sing-song voice.  At first it's a little scratchy, but something has definitely changed.  It's a real voice.  Treible smiles slightly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["There's your voice!"  Milstein says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Functional Dysphonia]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[There's a brief pause as Treible contemplates what has just happened.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["You can talk now," Milstein says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA["I can talk now," Treible says. "That's amazing."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[ Treible's condition, called functional dysphonia, is caused when the muscles that control the vocal cords tighten up and lock.  In Treible's case, the vocal cords were locked in an open position so that the air from her lungs simply passed over but not across the vocal cords themselves, so they were unable to vibrate and produce sound.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[By massaging and relaxing the muscles in her throat, Milstein was able to release the vocal cords and allow Treible to speak again -- all in about seven minutes.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["In order to produce voice, you need to have a very good balance of muscle tone in a lot of different muscles that are involved in voice production," Milstein says. "So an intervention like this, where basically you manipulate these muscles and try to restore the internal balance, is very effective." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[The problem, it turns out, is fairly common. Milstein estimates he sees about 10 patients like Treible every month, some of whom have been without a voice for up to two to three years. One reason for the delay in treatment, Milstein says, is that things like cancer, infection, acid reflux and neurological problems need to be ruled out -- and those diagnostics may involve multiple doctors, medications and expensive tests.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Cause Unknown]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Nelson Roy, a professor of speech language pathology at the University of Utah, says there is a definite shortage of speech pathologists who specialize in voice, and among them there is still a wide range of ability and experience.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA["When I look at the larynx and there might be a little bit of redness" but the patient talks in a hoarse voice, says Roy, "you have to be able to say the inflammation I'm seeing is insufficient to produce that kind of voice problem."  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[Furthermore, Roy says, no one really understands the underlying cause of functional dysphonia, and that has led many doctors to believe the disorder is psychological in nature.  Historically, many patients have languished in psychological treatment while their physical problem never got better.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA["These are complicated cases -- you're really straddling the territory between mind and body, and that's the territory medicine has a difficult time with," Roy says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[Psychological and stress management therapies are rarely effective alone, Roy says, and are best combined with a hands-on treatment or therapy where the patient learns how to use the voice differently. There is plenty of clinical evidence showing that physical manipulations of the voice box and voice therapy can be extraordinarily effective, but few controlled studies have compared treatments or studied their long-term effectiveness.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Although a subset of patients do experience relapses, Milstein says that in his hands, most patients have a permanent recovery. He demonstrates a set of vocal exercises for Treible to do several times a day for the next week after she leaves, which he says will help her strengthen her vocal cords and help them maintain their new relaxed position.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[However, today she has just one piece of homework.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA["For the rest of today, you have to talk nonstop," Milstein says with a smile. "I don't care who you talk to or what you talk about, just talk and talk and talk."  [Copyright 2011 Cleveland Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[SPAIN VS. GERMANY]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Like I said in my welcome post for "Cleats,"  I'm new to the World Cup and was eager to learn all about it.  So, I started blogging about soccer-subjects in my comfort zone -- fashion on the pitch, how I loved the ESPN announcers shouting the name of South African midfielder Tshabalala (something I still do, even though South Africa has been out for weeks), and the highlight of the Portugal/Brazil draw involving a shirtless Cristiano Ronaldo.  But as the World Cup progressed, I started reading everything I could get my hands on about "footy." I watched all the matches and took copious notes; I started to understand why people all over the world are so obsessed with this sport. And, a few days ago, as I was watching the semifinal match between Germany and Spain, my colleague secretly put a recording device in my cubicle.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[This bit of audio captures THE moment that I succumbed to "World Cup Fever" and I will never, ever be the same. Tshabalala! (Shereen Marisol Meraji, "Cleats" blog host and producer for All Things Considered)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[GOAL!]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[I have this crackpot theory that Landon Donovan's second-half goal against Slovenia is a microcosm of the future of American soccer. I don't speak as much in literal terms as figurative and aesthetic ideals. Consider that the team, owing to lapses and weaknesses obvious to any observer, put itself in a 2-0 hole at halftime to an inferior team. Then consider how desperately it rallied. Damned if we were going to allow our hard-won pride to be voided by our mind farts; that goal confirmed U.S. fans' rightful belief in our players' hearts, if not their legs.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[And, of course, there was the way it was scored. Donovan received the ball in space, instinctually dribbled toward the goal, and unselfishly looked for a teammate to lay it off to. But there was no teammate, and no real estate, and no angle. And so he thought, "Eff it, I'm just going to drill it as hard as I can at your head, and let come what may." And with that little bit of quintessentially American ingenuity, straight out of an action sequence in a shoot-em-up Western, surprise! The ball was in the roof of the net -- that counts, too, right? -- and we were on our way to forcing an inevitable equalizer, and perhaps more. See, we've had our growing pains in American soccer fandom, but we also have our moments, those which stand in for something greater about our spirit. We can't really say, "We shall not be denied," because heretofore, we always have been, eventually. But that day has arrived where we can proudly counter: "We shall not be denied -- without fighting back." (NPR Music's Patrick Jarenwattananon, editor, A Blog Supreme)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Landon Donovan. Do I have to be a fan, now? Because the moment he put the ball in the net against Algeria is what it's all about. Elation! Relief!! Joy!!! For one ecstatic moment, it erased all of the questions, doubts, boredom(!) and bad calls, replacing them with pride and excitement. (Wright Bryan, producer, NPR.org)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[For all the spectacular soccer and all the spectacularly stupid officiating, what I love best is watching games with my son. Tragically, he went off to summer camp in the middle of group play. Luckily, he didn’t have to have his heart broken in real time by the loss to Ghana. So my favorite moment had to be Clint Dempsey’s "Hand of Clod" goal against England.  My son and I both zoomed into very dark and gloomy places when Steven Gerrard picked the American pockets in the fourth minute of the first game. All hope was gone. So the jubilation at Dempsey’s equalizer was epic and brought joy to our man/boy cave. (Dick Meyer, executive editor, NPR News)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[When I first moved here to America at the end of 1993, only one of my new colleagues knew what I meant by “football.” How that has changed in the 16+ years since! Interest in the game, here in the office, has grown for each World Cup. On the morning the U.S. beat Algeria to qualify for the second round, work continued here in the newsroom … sort of. But you could hear the exhortations and groans emanating from desks and offices as the game progressed. When Landon Donovan scored his late winner, cheers abounded. "Football" had arrived at NPR!

        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[The 2010 World Cup had many notable moments on the pitch, but two of my favorites occurred in the locker room. First, England's squad got a visit from a random fan who gave them a good talking-to after they struggled to tie Algeria. When he called the players "a disgrace," an odd exchange followed. David Beckham: "Whoa. Who are you?" Random guy: "I'm Pavlos, and I actually need the toilet."  Days later, the U.S. team was visited by a former president. After watching the American side's rousing comeback to beat Algeria, Bill Clinton shocked U.S. players by not only paying a visit -- but also hanging out with them to chat about the tournament. He even popped a cold one -- leading to a nice photo-op with Carlos Bocanegra. (Bill Chappell, producer, NPR.org)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[GHANA VS. URUGUAY]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[My favorite moment of World Cup 2010 came during the final moments of Ghana's unfortunate loss to Uruguay. At one point, just before the penalty kicks began, the camera panned to the stands, to a man waving a sign that read, "Go Ghana! Make Africa Proud!" Despite the tension, he cheered excitedly, a huge grin bursting through his red, yellow and green face paint. He couldn't have been onscreen for more than a second or two, but that man and his sign gave me goosebumps, serving as a succinct reminder of just how much this Cup, Africa's first, meant to the continent's frequently disconnected citizens. Though they ultimately lost, all the African teams played valiantly, with heart and beauty. And Africa was proud. (Cord Jefferson, staff writer, The Root)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[Gyan’s penalty kick at the end of overtime versus Uruguay was, for me, the pinnacle of my World Cup experience.  It was a circumstance so unlikely that it seemed preposterous -- a handball on the goal line at the buzzer to give Africa its first shot at a World Cup semifinal, and on its own turf.  In the stadium, the reverberation of energy was magical.  In my friend’s photo (above), you can see the eager anticipation in the bodies of Ghana’s #18, #5 and #2 as well as the fans in the background who all seem to be standing on their toes.  I could already envision the ball firing into the goal and stretching out the back netting.  But in the blink of an eye, we went from pure elation to stunned disbelief.  All of us rooting for Ghana filed out of the stadium that night struggling with the implications of that moment and the searing pain of a dream deferred.  Even though it was an outcome I wished with all of my heart I could turn around, there was something beautiful about this night and I felt so lucky to be there. (Taku Noguchi, former soccer player attending his first World Cup)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Watching the inconsolable Asamoah Gyan double over on the field, sobbing, after Ghana’s loss to Uruguay. We were supposed to be working, but suddenly there we were — every member of my department -- huddled together in front of a small screen, trying not to cry for a team we hadn’t known we cared about a month earlier. (Heather Murphy, multimedia producer, NPR.org)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[The sparkling, collegial, colorful, flag-fluttering, vuvuzela-filled ambiance, plus the joyous welcome from the people of South Africa -- that's what I will remember.  Halala South Africa Halala! My worst moment?  That devastating volleyball movement by Luis Suarez, which put Ghana’s Black Stars out of World Cup 2010. (Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, NPR's Africa correspondent)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[When Luis Suarez volleyed that ball out of the goal, I was immediately spellbound. It was so blatantly wrong, it was so gutsy and thought-out, yet at the same time visceral, that it truly encapsulates the beauty of the sport. Maybe beauty is the wrong word: The play left me dizzy; the drama and the human conflict  -- Would Ghana go home? Was Suarez a cheater? -- that play made me a fan for life. (Eyder Peralta, associate producer, NPR.org)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[ORANJE!]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[Oh me of little faith! How fully and pessimistically I had braced myself for the possibility that the Dutch would choke in the quarterfinals. How wrong I was! And it’s hard to choose a favorite moment: Was it the sheer exhilarating glory of defeating Brazil? The pleasure of watching the exceptionally talented and determined Wesley Sneijder throughout the competition?  Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s absolute stunner of a goal in the semifinal against Uruguay? I can’t decide. Setting aside the question of style -- it’s been addressed here, there, everywhere -- one Dutch victory after another delighted me. But my other major source of pleasure throughout this strange and surprising World Cup? The camaraderie and -- regardless of our individual favorite teams-- we’re-in-it-together-ness I’ve enjoyed with old and new friends at the Black Horse. All these tears of joy, tears of sorrow, hugs, high fives, 60+ matches, countless sausage rolls and pints of beer later, it still feels like one big footy family.

        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[SOUTH AFRICA]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[The imprint for this World Cup was the novelty of the African setting, creating enormous contrasts of pomp and poverty. Navigating the quirks and contradictions of language while working in a linguistic confluence of English, Zulu, Xhosa and Afrikaans (and more) is a treat. Yes, Villa and Van Bronckhorst's goals will be replayed, Suarez's hand ball, Gyan's miss and the French and Italian shame will linger online. But I have imprinted the huge smiles and quirky pronunciation of the South Africans, who speak English with hard consonants and soft vowels. (Keyvan Heydari, a sportswriter who has covered every World Cup since 1986)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[The sound: of South Africa was the vuvuzela.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[The sight: was a yellow Bafana Bafana jersey; an ocean of 35,000 of them at the FIFA fan fest in Soweto when the South African national team played.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[The smell: was auto exhaust, stuck in traffic for two hours before the U.S. vs. Slovenia game held in Ellis Park. The directions to which train stations serviced the stadiums were inaccurate. The cops were helpful, but wrong about the locations of park and ride facilities. The guys on the street wearing reflective vests were clearly freelancers who were happy to park you in a spot that turned dicey after dark. Enter the new sound of South Africa -- the radio broadcast of the game you were trying to get to.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[The taste: of South Africa was Nando’s chicken – yum!  The other taste was Biltong, South African beef jerky, but with more vinegar, made with stranger animals -- not as yum.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[The feel: was joyous, communal, dramatic, proud, at times transcending sport; at other, equally important times, anchored by sports, like when dozens of South Africans or Americans donned the colors of North Korea before their match with Portugal. When questioned about supporting a member of the Axis of Evil, they answered, “This is sport, mate, it's beyond politics.”]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[The final sound of South Africa was that inescapable Shakira song, about 500 Americans and Ghanaians learning to do "the Waka Waka," not quite getting the steps, but when that one lyric came on -- the entire crowd stopping and screaming:]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In 1967, in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, white Katharine Houghton brought black fiance Sidney Poitier to visit parents Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn; and though the film was a creaky sitcom, it captured something of mainstream culture's imminent upheaval. Now comes Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right, another situation comedy -- a stupendous one -- that shakes up our way of looking at the family.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The parents are a same-sex couple, Nic and Jules -- they're women -- and the guess-who who comes to dinner is their anonymous sperm donor, located by their two teenage children, Joni and Laser. Each mother carried a child, so they both received his contribution, but neither expected him to be an influence on her kids. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Annette Bening's Nic is a doctor and more the authority figure, and Bening wears a short, fluffy haircut; lowers her voice, purging its tinkle; and presents to her kids a mask of stability, of someone who values structure above all. Nic doesn't articulate her political agenda, but it's implicit: that two moms can create a home that's every bit as traditional as one with a mother and father. She is admirable but also a bit of a pill -- and Bening has a genius for illuminating the gap between the facade and the person underneath, desperately trying to hold the mask in place. Like the best comic protagonists, Nic takes herself too seriously -- which guarantees her orderly universe will become untethered.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Enter Mark Ruffalo as Paul, the freewheeling hetero-bachelor restaurateur. Over the meal, Nic wears a frozen smile but questions him with visible distaste. But there are frequent cuts to the fascinated kids, Mia Wasikowska's studious Joni and Josh Hutcherson's Laser -- who's struggling in school, doing drugs and unable to conform to Nic's view of him. He's especially taken by his "bio-dad's" view of higher education when Nic asks Paul why he works in the food services industry.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["Well, I always liked food," he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["Well I was asking," she says, "because I remember when I was reading your file back when we were looking for sperm, you said that you were studying international relations."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Yeah, that was a long time ago," says Paul. "Um. Yeah. I was considering it but then I dropped out of school."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["You dropped out of college?" asks Joni.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["Yeah, it just wasn't my thing."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Why's that?" says Nic, pouring some more wine.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["It just seemed like massive waste of money after a while," says Paul. "I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout ideas I could have just as easily learned in a book."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["Oh," says Nik. "Okay."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["I'm not saying that I think higher learning uniformly blows," says Paul. "I think college is great for some people. Joni, I think you're going to love it. But I'm a doer. That's how I learn. I'm just weird that way I guess."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"/>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Director Lisa Cholodenko is best known for the amusing-though-finally-tragic lesbian love story, High Art, but for The Kids Are All Right she collaborated with a more a commercial screenwriter, Stuart Blumberg. They contrive a flirtation between Paul and Jules, played by Julianne Moore, whose lyric ditheriness carries echoes of Diane Keaton. But as a duettist, Moore is in a class of her own. She takes on the rhythms of her co-stars -- suggesting how marriage to the strong-willed Nic has kept Jules soft and suggestible.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[It's easy to see why Paul charms her, since Ruffalo has a magnetic flakiness, and when Paul tries to reach out to his newfound family, he's touchingly awkward. The kid actors are more than all right. The watchful Wasikowska shows the wheels turning in Joni's head, trying to re-assemble the puzzle pieces of her life; and Hutcherson lets you glimpse the person fighting to emerge from under layers of defenses. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Cholodenko has a female partner and a child, and in a political climate hostile to gay families it must be hard for her even to suggest that two moms might not be enough. But she's a true dramatist. She tests what is presumably her own design for living; she bombards it with every satirical weapon in her arsenal. Then she picks up the pieces and rebuilds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[But Cholodenko also wants you to see that despite the gaps in the pioneer family life of Nic and Jules, Joni and Laser have enough of a foundation, enough love, to grope their way to all-rightness. The self-satire of The Kids Are All Right is so rich, so hilarious, so healthy you wonder how anyone could find a reason to vote against it.

        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[In The Shadow Artist -- a 1920 magazine illustration and part of Lucas' collection -- Rockwell paints a white-bearded gentleman standing in profile against a wall that's bathed in light from an oil lamp.

        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Rockwell's job was to grab a reader's attention at newsstands that were crowded with magazine covers.  You don't really linger in front of these paintings as you would with Claude Monet or Pablo Picasso.  ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Then the artist hunted down the right costumes for them to wear -- the little girl's red ribbon, the blond's white hat -- and the right props -- a 1930s radio microphone, an Underwood typewriter.  Then he gathered his costumed cast together for a photograph. Finally, back in his studio, Rockwell created his painting. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA[Rockwell's paintings have achieved iconic status in the U.S., but that doesn't keep people from knocking his work.  He's been called saccharine, sentimental and soppy, and many museums still don't take him seriously.  But Lucas says that very sweetness is what sets Rockwell apart.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA["In the art world it's called corny and naive," Lucas says. "You can take the corny and naive out of the American spirit -- out of these images -- and you end up with a lot of what is going on today, which is the same ideas, only without any of the heart, without any of the human compassion."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Gru is despicable -- on purpose. He means to be the biggest villain in the world, in fact, but he's not very good at villainy. And he's got competition. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[So Gru, voiced in the agreeably offbeat new animated comedy Despicable Me by Steve Carell, gets no respect, not even from his mom (Julie Andrews), who calls him in his jet-car when she hears about the theft of one of the great pyramids of Egypt.  Supposedly she's phoning to congratulate him -- but really she's reaching out to touch a sore spot (it wasn't Gru's caper) and torment her offspring with the fact that someone's a more successful villain than he is. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Gru's evil plans are nonetheless plenty big. Also inordinately complicated, involving shrink rays, bank loans, rockets and most of all minions. He's got hundreds of chattering little minions -- odd little helpers who look like really big smiling yellow pills -- and who cheerfully do their thoroughly misguided best to help Gru. This being an animated comedy, the results are usually not quite what he intended, and often they spell disaster for at least a few of their minion buddies. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[For reasons complicated enough that you'll want to discover them for yourself, Gru also gets involved with three little orphan girls; technically he adopts them, but practically speaking they're in control, even when he's making the rules.   ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[It's all thoroughly adorable, and with an overlay that's nearly as odd as Carell's accent: Despicable Me looks a lot like other computer-animated pictures -- white picket fence suburbs, rounded characters, sleek and modern, but with a retro afterglow. Gru and his minions deploy all manner of weird contraptions --  that jet-car, which looks sort of steam-powered; cookie robots that skitter like insects -- as if Jules Verne somehow got into the Pixar toolbox. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The film does come from a French animation studio, so it makes sense that it would feel a little different. Also that the storytelling would take some unexpected turns -- villains with mommy issues and daddy trouble, shout-outs to Jaws and Spy vs. Spy. There are some tricky visual turns too, including a ride on a roller coaster that, if you see it in 3-D, will give you vertigo for sure. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[And don't leave when the end credits start, or you'll miss the minions doing a nifty little deconstruction of 3-D. Judging from the mishaps that befall them during the picture, I'd have said these little yellow dudes were kinda dim, but they establish while the credits roll that they understand 3-D a heck of a lot better than the folks who made The Last Airbender or Clash of the Titans. Maybe they should try their little minion hands at directing. (Recommended)  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[If I actually worked for a living, chances are me and the boys might have had a good time around the water cooler a few weeks ago rehashing The New York Times story about the new line of Spanx for Men. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[You know Spanx, those hide the doughnut undergarments that press the flesh back to the bones they used to cling to before middle age set in? In Mae West's day, they called 'em girdles, which no self-respecting feller would think of wearing under his shirt and pants. Women, however, have bought millions of dollars' worth of Spanx in the past decade. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Now men are being invited to wear the boa constrictor shapewear in an attempt to conceal the ravages of life in the fat lane. No stringent diets, no messy surgery, just slip on the undershirt that embraces you like an old friend and button up your dress shirt over it. Congratulations, sir, you have just lost a virtual 20 pounds, so prepare a response for when your colleagues ask if you've been sick or had some kind of, uh, procedure. Smile conspiratorially, wink at the camera and say, "Thanks, Spanx!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[As NPR's crack underwear sleuth, I ventured over to the mall last week to see if I could cajole a department store salesman into feeding me a few quotes on this white-hot topic. He took one look at my digital voice recorder and immediately radioed for help. When his boss arrived, I was escorted upstairs to speak with someone in corporate, who confirmed the don't ask policy when it came to floor staff. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Eventually, I spoke with the Spanx public relations folks directly, who generously offered an interview with the company's founder, Sara Blakely. Thank you, I said, but I really just wanted to have a down-home, dude-to-dude kind of encounter. Heck, I can't talk underwear with a girl!]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The final word came down. Spanx would let me talk with anyone I pleased, so I returned to the mall only to be rebuffed once again by a corporate handler. "Yes, but Spanx said it was OK," I protested weakly and to no avail. I had apparently reached the barbed wired, electrified perimeter of the Area 51 of underwear. I might as well have asked if their mannequins were castoffs from an alien autopsy. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[I shuffled back to the parking lot, crestfallen. My turn as the Seymour Hersh of compression garments had been scuttled by an unfeeling bureaucracy less interested in bulky truth than in looking after its slender corporate image. Did they think I would gull their salesman into ridiculing the miracle waist-eraser? That I'd ask sarcastic questions like, "If I buy Spanx, can I give up my gym membership?" ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[OK, I admit it, they were right to worry, but after Spanx sent me a free crew-neck shirt in the maiI, I became a true believer. Call me Slim and make mine a double cheeseburger.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The peace of an otherwise quiet summer weekend is often muddled by the sound of lawn mowers and leaf blowers. In Los Angeles’ business district, an old-fashioned method of ground control provides an alternative soundtrack -- the munching of goats.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[In a steep hillside city park on Bunker Hill, right next to the world’s shortest railway, 120 goats are about to be deployed. "Oh my gosh, they're so cute," Nate Giddings says as he makes his way to work in a nearby skyscraper. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[There are baby goats and mama goats, but they're all hungry goats. This natural landscaping crew was trucked in from a farm in San Diego. Their assignment: mowing down the unruly growth of brush on these 2 1/2 acres.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The goats belong to Johnny Gonzalez, who says they get an undeserved bad rap. "Goats are great survivalists," he says. "They learn to survive on meager means, so people tend to think of them as doing something destructive. But the goats allow the natural plants to take hold and pretty much do away with all the invasive weeds and grasses."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[They also entertain thousands of passersby in the process. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[For these few days, Bunker Hill has become a mix of the fiercely urban and charmingly bucolic. Just ask Finney, one of several homeless men who sleep here. Today, he's right beside where the goats are working, and he likes how they make the big, busy city more human. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["They make everybody smile. Normally people come and go here to the Metro. It's so nice to see people stopping and smiling and laughing," he says. "It creates this kind of warmth, this unity. People talk about it, you know."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[There's probably no more charged phrase in all of the American lexicon than "the great white hope," signifying the pride of one race over another. The phrase itself came into existence almost exactly 100 years ago in the era of Jack Johnson, the great American heavyweight fighter who happened to be black. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Though black and white boxers often matched up, at that time the world heavyweight championship remained a "whites only" proposition. That a black could challenge a white in the squared circle, let alone defeat him, was simply too incendiary to be allowed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[In fact, reigning world heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries chose to retire rather than risk losing the title to Johnson in the ring.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[But Johnson, a guy who basically lived his life with a metaphorical middle finger raised in the air, wasn't about to be relegated to being the "Negro" champ. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[He literally chased Canadian champion Tommy Burns around the globe for nearly two years until Burns gave Johnson his shot. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[On Dec. 26, 1908, the two met in Sydney. Fourteen rounds later, the fight was stopped for fear of a white riot at the sight of Burns getting beaten so badly. Johnson was crowned the first black world heavyweight champ.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Well, now, this "injustice" could not stand. A champion of the cause had to be found to win back the title. Which brings us to Jack No. 2. Jack London, the noted American writer who summed up all the collective teeth-gnashing going on by openly calling for a "great white hope" to step up and win back their race's pride.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[London wrote: "Jim Jeffries must now emerge from his Alfalfa farm and remove that golden smile from Jack Johnson's face. Jeff, it's up to you. The White Man must be rescued."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[That, of course, makes London something of my own personal Wagner; terrific artist, lousy humanitarian. But at the time -- one after another -- the other "hopes" stepped up, shouldering their race's aspirations. And with equal regularity, Johnson dashed them, defeating all comers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[And then, in 1910, James Jeffries -- who'd previously put the dodge on Johnson by going into retirement -- grandly unretired largely at the urging of people like London. Jeffries announced to the world that he would "reclaim the heavyweight championship for the white race."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[A hundred years ago, on July 4, 1910, on a specially built stage in Reno, Nev., Johnson and Jeffries squared off. The fight was called the "battle of the century," no matter that the century was only 10 years old. There were 16,000 people in attendance. Another 1,500 bum-rushed the gate. President William Taft was asked to referee the fight, but he wisely declined. The rumor at the time: There was a gunman in the audience. If Jeffries didn't drop Johnson, the gunman would.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Truth is, Jeffries was a lousy candidate to bear the standard for his race. He came into the fight overconfident and out of shape, the 110-degree temperature at fight time doing as much damage as the sharper Johnson. A fight that was originally scheduled for an amazing 45 rounds lasted only 15. After being sent to the canvas for the first time in his career, Jeffries quit rather than suffer the humiliation of a knockout.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[This second great Independence Day was marred by white riots in the fight's aftermath that left dozens of people of color dead across America. But dead, too, was the notion of the great white hope, though its ghost still haunts us today.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[For his involvement in all this, writer Jack London tends to get a historical pass. His racial politics aren't taught alongside his writings, which leaves that kind of educating up to the individual. Neither Johnson nor London was a perfect person. I teach my kids the wholeness of both. Some would say London's views aren't germane to his work. But 100 years later, I say helping to popularize the concept of the "great white hope" has had more of a cultural impact than "To Build a Fire" ever did.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[At a small dusty field just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah, mostly male spectators cheer and wave flags as a car speeds though a turn on the racetrack.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The car comes to a halt and the racer, 24-year-old Mona Ennab, jumps out. When she slides off her helmet and smiles at the crowd, it's not hard to see why she was a contestant for Miss Palestine, the West Bank's beauty pageant. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[She's part of a team of Palestinian women competing in the West Bank's burgeoning professional car racing scene. After placing in the top 10 in several recent races, the female team has sped from curious anomaly to serious competition.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[And the former beauty pageant contestant she says is proud of her skills behind the wheel.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["I was the first girl to make the race here in Palestine," Ennab says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[The Speed Sisters]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Ennab says she has been racing for more than seven years. This year, she's part of a team, the Speed Sisters, a group of female race car drivers that is breaking stereotypes -- and records, the women hope -- in the Arab world's increasingly popular car racing scene.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Khaled Khadoura, head of the Palestinian Motorsport Federation, says that it took no time for women to move from novelty racers at the track to serious competitors. "I'm very proud to see our young women today taking an interest in race car driving, and training in order to improve themselves," Khadoura says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The group has welcomed a new driver and potential teammate, Sahar Jawabrah, 44. She stands out as she wears an Islamic headscarf underneath her helmet on the track.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[During the daytime she works in a library and tends to her four children, but she says she always fantasized about car racing. "Here you are alone, just alone, just one. It's more dangerous, it's better than going fast in the street," Jawabrah says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[As she takes her tiny Daewoo out for a trial run around the track, the engine stalls and she nervously jolts the car back to life. She doesn't place in the top bracket, but she finishes the race to the cheers of the other Speed Sisters.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[Clerics, Some Men Disapprove]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[But not everyone is happy to see her on the track. Despite the growing popularity of racing across the Arab world, a number of Muslim clerics have spoken out against the sport.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Jawabrah says she's heard men call it haram, or forbidden, but she thinks they are ill-informed. There is nothing wrong with racing, she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[While most of the men at the races applaud just as loudly for the female racers as for the men, some say they are uncomfortable with women at the racetrack.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Tareq Sarsou, a 33-year-old Ramallah store owner, says that while he was impressed by the sport, he isn't sure it's appropriate for Palestinian society. "I would not allow my wife, my sister or my daughter to race here," Sarsou says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[In this season's races, nearly all the women fared well against the men. And one of the Speed Sisters earned a spot in the top 10 rankings.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Like many of the women on the team, Ennab says she began her racing career almost by accident. "I love cars, I love speed, so I drive fast. And after they see me in Ramallah when I drive fast they told me to come to the federation and join," she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[Channeling Road Rage]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[And by fast she means more than half a dozen speeding tickets off the track in a single month.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Nearly all the team members have similar stories. They take pride in the fact that every member of the Speed Sisters has been issued speeding tickets. Some, like Ennab, were told by police to speak to Khadoura about racing on the track.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Some of that training has come thanks to the British Consulate, which flew in two professional drivers for a two-day workshop with the Speed Sisters earlier this month.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[Karen McLuskie, the British political consul, discovered the women last year and has since become a patron of the team.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA["I think for me, driving isn't like any other sports; men and women can compete in the same race. And you know what -- they're beginning to get there," McLuskie says. "At the beginning of the season we had one of our girls who won her category. And you should have seen the faces of those guys."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[This time it's war -- or something. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[What's starting, to clarify things, is a war with the "newborns" -- fresh-bitten vampires who are stronger than the usual sort, apparently. But the blood sport that Twilight fans will care about is the fight for high school heroine Bella, a battle waged between chilly but sparkly vampire Edward and hotblooded wolf-boy Jacob, he of the washboard abs. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[But wait: Edward ended the last movie with a proposal of marriage, so everything's decided, right? Mmmm, not so much. As Jacob snarls during a confrontation with Edward, "She doesn't know what she wants!" ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Macho posturing aside, that newborn vampire army is headed their way from Seattle, and the werewolves and the vampires need to work together to defeat them. Mostly this involves striking poses in the woods, snarling a lot, and waiting ... a lot.  Also much bickering between Edward and Jacob in the high school parking lot.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[It is during one of these bouts of male posturing that Kristen Stewart's Bella, refusing to choose sides, says, "I'm Switzerland," and it hits me. I'd been seeing this story in terms of high school gangs -- Sharks and Jets (or wolves and bats, or whatever) -- when there's a much better metaphor: geopolitics. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Think about it: Aging European aristocracy (Edward being 109 years old and downright Byronic) meets virile, all-American boy (Jacob having spent most of his 16 years in the tribe's gymnasium). Pasty, anemic Edward loves poetry and sitting in blossom-filled meadows. Brawny Jacob likes hikes in the woods and sitting 'round campfires. Sure, they'll be allies when the Germans -- um, the newborns -- threaten. But they're basically from different worlds. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Even their acting styles match up: Robert Pattinson's an English thespian, giving Edward sad eyes and a smile that looks like indigestion. Taylor Lautner's Jacob is such a chest-thumping Brando-wannabe that you half expect him to throw his head back and shout "Bell-llaaaaaaaa!" ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The film around them has pretty scenery, pretty people, pretty wolves and pretty broad winks at the audience, including a jokey male-bonding scene atop a mountain ... in a tent. Bella falls asleep between her hunky boyfriends, and the two of them talk about the pain of love till the sun comes up. (All that's missing is a herd of sheep outside -- and maybe the chime of a single forlorn guitar string on the soundtrack.)]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Director David Slade keeps the action brisk and the time-killing attractive. There are better special effects than last time, and Bella gets to be brave when it counts. All of which should be like a freshly opened vein for fans -- especially as it results in Eclipse ending up almost exactly where it started, with weddings still to come. Can you wait?

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[If you watch this video and don't get to the part where Eugene Hutz is dancing on the desks, then you've missed the most rollicking and insane Tiny Desk Concert of all time.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[I've seen Gogol Bordello at a nightclub, and its live show is a gypsy punk circus, complete with a high-wire act. So when the band arrived at the modest NPR Music offices, I wanted to make sure we were covered technically; I figured they'd move around and wind up singing far away from our microphones. I asked Sergey Ryabtsev -- Gogol Bordello's Russian-born violinist -- if he thought bandleader Eugene Hutz might wind up dancing on my desk. With a huge smile and a large shot glass of vodka in hand, he said, "Don't worry about it!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[By the third song, Hutz was sitting with the NPR crew in an office chair, singing his ode to alcohol. By the fourth, he was jumping from desktop to desktop, singing and dancing.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Gogol Bordello is based in New York City, and has been performing its theatrical concoction of accordion, violin and guitar since the late '90s. The band writes songs about immigration and the celebration of cultural differences. Now, for 2010, Gogol Bordello has its fifth album out -- its first on a major label. Producer Rick Rubin, known for his Johnny Cash production and for co-founding Def Jam Records, helped make Trans-Continental Hustle. It's an album with more range than sheer thrust, and though the band played a few songs from that album at the desk, when Gogol Bordello is in front of a crowd, it's in full-throttle mode. No complaints there.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Angelique Kidjo is an internationally renowned singer from Benin. Her latest album, Oyo, which pays tribute to the artists who've influenced her, was released in April.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[If I tell you about my seven brothers, you will understand why soccer was so important in my early life. In order to complete the team, and though I was petite, I would always end up as the goalkeeper.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[I remember, when it was announced that the World Cup would take place in South Africa, Nelson Mandela cried. I felt right away it was a turning point for my continent.    ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[I sing all over the world, and I am trying to show the beauty and richness of Africa to all kinds of different people. I spend all my life fighting against what the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie calls the "danger of a single story" of African wars and poverty. Even when I traveled to South Africa for the World Cup, I saw the headlines on the television at the airport: One of the highest crime rates in the world, and the Colombian team robbed in a hotel room. The media want to get back to that "single story"!]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But as soon as I landed, I felt the enthusiasm, joy and pride in the air. I went to the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg for a news conference about the World Cup Kick-off Celebration Concert. Contrary to the predictions of the Western media, the great building that looks like a giant calabash was ready in time for the opening match. Instead of making a speech at the news conference, I followed the traditions of Benin and decided to sing a thank-you song. The sound whirled around in the empty stadium. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[At the concert itself, I sang the old classic "Move On Up" with John Legend. Curtis Mayfield wrote it for the African-American youth 40 years ago. John and I dedicated it to the African youth.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Then came the most touching moment of my trip. After my performance, I sat next to Desmond Tutu on the side of the stage as he waited to make his speech. He told me, "We just want to say we can do it. Yes we can, said Obama. Now it's our turn to say we can. And we will!" ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[The next day I couldn't help blowing my loud vuvuzela when South Africa scored first during the opening match. The first goal of the World Cup went to Africa! I took this as a good omen for my beloved continent. I know a sports event will not change the future of Africa in one day, but you have to agree, it is such a powerful symbol of hope. My continent is on the cover of The New York Times now, not because of conflicts and abuses, but because of joy and sport and excitement.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Now I'm back in North America, and everywhere people ask me, "How was it? How was South Africa?" ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Even though the African teams have not done so well since that first goal, I still have a big smile. I'm so proud to have been the witness of this great moment for my continent.   [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Greece is trying to drag itself out of debt, while at the same time imposing an austerity program that is limiting growth. One of the country's best hopes for overcoming this paradox is the tourism industry, which employs about one-fifth of the Greek workforce and accounts for up to 18 percent of gross domestic product. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But media coverage of the Greek economic meltdown and the sometimes violent anti-austerity protests are threatening to keep tourists away. In yet another blow last week, Moody's Investors Service slashed the country's credit rating to junk status.]]></paragraph>

Three years later, the country is broke.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In 1999, Tom DeBaggio was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. He was 57.  Soon after the diagnosis, he began talking with NPR about his illness. He wanted to document his decline, to break through what he called the "shame and silence" of Alzheimer's.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"/>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[NPR's Noah Adams started the visits with Tom, his wife, Joyce, and his son, Francesco, at DeBaggio's Herb Farm and Nursery in Chantilly, Va.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA["I still talk, I still stand up on both feet, I still look the same -- maybe they go out of here and say, 'Doesn't look like anything wrong with him.' And of course you don't see it," he said in 1999. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Over the course of a year, Tom DeBaggio described his growing confusion with language: the sudden, inexplicable tears. And the waves of anger that came with Alzheimer's.    ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[I picked up the conversations in 2005. Tom took me through the nursery, proud to show off dozens of kinds of tomato plants. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[When I visited Tom again three years ago, his decline was pronounced.  He couldn't name the disease he has, but he could still express his feelings about it.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["I still don't understand why. It just happened in, I guess. I can still do things -- but it's hard to do. And I sure hope that Francesco and all of those people, and everybody like that, that they wouldn't have to go through this," he said. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Since then, I've kept thinking about DeBaggio and his family. Listeners have written in, too, wondering how they're doing.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[The Update]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I went to see them again.  The visit began with this question to Joyce:  "Would he want us to see him?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["I know that's what he wanted," Joyce says. "Till the very end, he wants to people to know. We just discussed it endlessly. He wanted to throw it in people's faces basically, this is Alzheimer's." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Joyce took me to visit Tom at the nursing home where he's been living for the past two years.   ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[She had resisted putting Tom there. She wanted him to be in his own house as long as possible. But finally, his care became overwhelming. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[Tom was dressed and in a wheelchair when we got there. He can no longer walk or use his hands. His language now is gone. He's thinner than when I last saw him, his face hollow. But he had flashes of animation and smiles. And at moments, he seemed to want to express himself.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["Today is Friday, you're Tom DeBaggio. I'm Joyce. Francesco says 'hello,' " she said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Throughout our visit, Joyce held Tom's hand, though she says she's not sure whether Tom wants her to touch him.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["Sometimes I think it's comforting and then other times I'm not sure. One time he actually said, 'Don't touch me.' Normally, he doesn't like to be handled, which I think is perfectly reasonable. When they change him, he screams and screams and lashes out. He's not going quietly."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[At lunchtime, Joyce fed Tom. Everything was pureed, because swallowing is a problem. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[It was a long, painstaking process.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[When she left, she told him she'd see him next week.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA["Bye-bye for now," she said. "For now. I'll be back, OK. I'll be back."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA['This Could Be Me']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA[Later that day, Joyce and I discussed the visit. We talked in the nursery, the business Tom started 35 years ago. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA["He's truly trying to say something. There's something still in his mind. That's what's so heartbreaking, you don't know what's in his mind, what he's trying to say. What's so hurtful is I don't know if he knows that's he's not communicating. Because sometimes I feel that he's disappointed in my response because he'll sort of look away in disgust sometimes, like when I say, 'Oh yeah, yeah, OK,' in response to some babbling. Which was not the response, but I don't know what that's supposed to be because I don't know what he's saying."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA[I asked her if he still feels like her husband to her.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA["Not really, no. I mean, I know it's Tom. It looks like Tom. I said, 'It,' I can't believe I just said, 'It.' But there's no communication. I mean, our relationship is based on communication. We talked about everything. We talked and talked and talked, and now we can't. That's been the most difficult."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[After he was diagnosed, DeBaggio wrote two eloquent, intimate books about his life before and after Alzheimer's.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[In one, he wrote of his fear that he has passed the genes for Alzheimer's on to son Francesco. That thought, he said, was "almost more than anyone could bear."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Francesco is 45 now. He runs the farm, and it's thriving. He says he and his father never talked about that genetic question.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA["I know my mom has told me that they had those conversations," he says. "And I've never read the books. It's not something I think I can handle -- it's too raw. The double edge of it being my father and then applying all that to my future -- I just can't do it."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Francesco says he has no desire to see a genetic counselor. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="33"><![CDATA["If they could do something preventively, and I found out, then I'd certainly be more likely to do it. ... I'm certainly going to be aware of the symptoms and hopefully be able to go at that point. But knowing ahead of time wouldn't give me any peace of mind. You know, when it first happened with him, I was thinking, 'Gosh, next week that could be happening to me.' I just was a little worried. And just keenly interested in what was happening to him, with the thought that, 'This could be me.' At the time it was, 'This will be. Now it's, this could be me.'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="34"><![CDATA[Francesco got back to work in the sweltering heat. He told me the last time he went to see his father in the nursing home was last year, on Father's Day. He'll go back, he says, once work in the nursery slows down. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA['It's Amazing How Many People Have The Same Story']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="36"><![CDATA[Joyce visits Tom once a week. She used to go almost every day. It gets harder and harder, she says. She'll sit in the parking lot for a long time to get her courage up. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="37"><![CDATA[It's been a long road for Joyce. She says that Tom's friends and fans ask about him, more and more -- or they'll ask her if he's still alive, she says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="38"><![CDATA["What's so wrenching, there's so many that have Alzheimer's in their family. Or they've just lost someone, or someone just been diagnosed. It just makes you cry, listening to all of their stories. It's heartening, too, that they can talk about it. It's absolutely amazing how many people have the same story."

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose economies are the major engines in the 16-country zone using the euro, tried to put forward a united front in talks in Berlin on Monday night.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But their meeting did little to mask deeper disagreements on how to further address the worst crisis in the eurozone's 11-year history. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have already agreed to nearly $1 trillion in debt guarantees for eurozone governments that need help. In yet another blow to Greece, Moody's Investors Service slashed the country's credit rating to junk status on Monday after the government in Athens only narrowly avoided default last month.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The EU is still trying to convince skeptical financial markets that the group has a clear and unified strategy for stopping the sovereign debt problems from infecting other economically troubled eurozone countries. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[France and Germany have the largest economies in the eurozone. The two leaders have made some recent moves toward unity: Last week they called for an EU-wide ban on certain speculative trading practices. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Nonetheless, the markets will be watching the next summit of EU leaders on Thursday for signs of a definite consensus on how to reform the troubled eurozone. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[The magazine Der Spiegel over the weekend wrote that German-French relations are now at a postwar "historic low." The Paris daily Le Figaro said the two leaders "have never been this far apart." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[So with the risk of a political crisis exacerbating an economic one, Merkel and Sarkozy met Monday for talks and dinner.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Sarkozy told a press conference that talk of a French-German division on how to handle the situation is highly exaggerated. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["I think those who see us from the outside don't really understand how the relationship works. We are two very frank persons who have our convictions and we take great pleasure in debating and discussing them," Sarkozy said.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"/>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[But the two leaders took only four questions, and the smiles and kind words didn't cover the fact that the two still have fundamental disagreements. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Since the Greek problem became a full-blown crisis, France has called for creation of an economic government for the eurozone. Paris wants a new body with a dedicated secretariat that would hold regular summits and enforce coordination and fiscal policy for the 16 countries that use the euro.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Germany is resisting. Merkel thinks a greater emphasis on fiscal discipline and tighter rules for all 27 EU members will help the sovereign debt problem.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[The French -- along with senior U.S. officials -- have pressured export-dependent Germany to spend more to stimulate growth.

        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Take Megan Sikora. In the revival of Promises, Promises, a splashy 1960s musical starring Sean Hayes and Kristin Chenoweth, she's not just in the chorus -- "I play Miss Polansky, who is the 'Turkey Lurkey' girl in the green dress," Sikora says, mentioning the big first act showstopper. "I play Sylvia and I play a very angry nurse and, you know, dancer, here and there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[As if that weren't enough, Sikora understudies Chenoweth and Katie Finneran, the odds-on favorite to win the Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, for her loopy portrayal of a drunken barfly named Marge. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I'm onstage a lot, which makes it difficult to watch the ladies that I understudy and pay attention, because it's my responsibility, as an understudy, to know the ins and outs of their job, so that if I got thrown on, Sean Hayes would not be…," she pauses.  "I wouldn't rock his boat, by doing something dramatically different."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Sikora says a lot of essential work gets done on Thursday and Friday afternoons, when all the understudies are called for rehearsals. "We have play practice, basically -- that's what we like to call it," says Sikora. "And it's our chance to physicalize it … and say everything out loud … and really find your version of it, because I don't think anybody wants to see an understudy go on and just do a poor imitation of what they would've seen."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[So, imagine what it must be like to understudy  both  Tony-nominated stars of the Tony-nominated revival of  La Cage aux Folles, Kelsey Grammer and Douglas Hodge.  That's Chris Hoch's job.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[He says both roles are enormous, but "Doug's is the more terrifying -- not only the parameters of the role itself, but his performance is just so outside the box, you have to give a flavor of that and it's absolutely terrifying!  I wake up every morning and I pray for his health!"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Most Broadway insiders consider the British-born Hodge a lock to win the Tony for Best Leading Actor in a Musical, playing the fluttery drag performer Albin. In one number, Albin literally applies makeup and gets dressed in front of the audience. To prepare himself as an understudy, Hoch says, he's not only memorized the lines and the staging, but he's gone to transsexual sites on the Web and, during off hours, descends the four flights of stairs from his dressing room to get comfortable walking in high heels onstage.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["I mean, it's funny," he laughs. "I go down every once in a while and just walk around in the heels."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Hoch, who also plays the masochistic stage manager in La Cage, has understudied in several Broadway shows, and is well aware that he may never get the call to step into Hodge's pumps. He says actors shouldn't take the job expecting the lead actor to get sick and to become a star themselves.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[He brings up the famous Bette Davis movie All About Eve, in which Davis' evil understudy conspires to keep the star offstage. "An Eve Harrington moment is always, I think, frowned upon by the company, for good reason," Hoch explains. "You have a big responsibility to your fellow actors when you do it, more so than you do to yourself."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[A Chance To Take On An Outsize Performance]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[For some actors, being an understudy allows them to play roles they wouldn't ordinarily be considered for.  Stephen Rowe has played small roles in several Broadway shows, like Frost/Nixon.  Now, he's understudying a Tony-nominated star, Alfred Molina, in Red, a play about artist Mark Rothko.  Molina and Denzel Washington, who stars in Fences, are running neck-and-neck for the prize of Best Actor in a Play.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Rowe knows it might be easy to think of himself as a second-class citizen, but learning the role has been its own reward. "I really was excited about doing this, because I thought it's a part that I really need to have challenge me," he says, sitting in his dressing room backstage at the Golden Theatre, with a well-worn biography of Rothko on the makeup table. "I really need to tilt at this windmill a little bit because I hadn't played a part of this size and this magnitude and of this forcefulness."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Because Red is a two-character play, Rowe doesn't have another role in the production, but that doesn't mean he isn't busy. He comes to the theater at least an hour before every performance; he watches the show from the audience twice a week, taking notes; and he runs lines backstage with the other understudy.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["I feel that I have to touch all of the lines in the play every day," he says. "If I lose touch with it, more than my day off, I get a little nervous."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[And like a pinch hitter in baseball, Rowe always keeps his head in the game, just in case Molina goes down. "You have to start thinking about 'What would happen if…,'" he says. "And, you know, Fred is such a horse, as a man and as an actor, part of you thinks, 'Well, if I don't get a call by 4 o'clock, it's not gonna happen,' but it's a little bit of a mind game."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Rowe doesn't go home until after the start of the fifth and final scene of the play, just in case.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[While it hasn't happened yet, Rowe is steeling himself for the inevitable groan of disappointment from the audience that comes with the announcement that he -- not Molina -- will be playing the part of Rothko tonight.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["I look forward to it," he says, smiling. "That's life, that's OK. I mean, the thing you do is you make sure you either have your ears plugged for that, or just sort of embrace it and say, 'Just you watch now. OK?'"]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[The Roman Catholic Church in Europe is struggling with a shortage of priests. In France, the number of priests has been in steady decline since the 1960s. Determined to reverse that trend, the Catholic Church recently launched a public relations campaign meant to attract more young men to the priesthood.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But the campaign has come at a difficult time, amid ever-expanding sex scandals, and its intended targets are skeptical.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[On a recent Sunday, bells call the faithful to morning Mass at St. Christophe de Javel Catholic Church in Paris' 15th arrondissement.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[The Rev. Paul Ndour leads the congregation in song and prayer. An African priest from Senegal, Ndour has been preaching at St. Christophe since last August, and he will stay in France for two years. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Ndour is one of about 1,500 foreign priests in parishes across the country who are helping to fill in for the dearth of French priests. Ndour says his time in France has been a wonderful opportunity for him and his congregation.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["This has been a rich experience that has fostered more openness on both sides. For example, before, I had an image of French priests as missionaries or colonizers. But now I see that I was wrong," Ndour says. "And I also feel that I'm teaching the congregation many things through our exchanges."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Improving The Image Of French Priests]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[In the 1960s, there were about 41,000 priests in France. Today, there are around 15,000. About 800 priests die each year, and only 100 are ordained.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Frederic Fonfroide de Lafon is the head of the firm that the church has hired to run its public relations campaign. He says to attract new priests the church must first improve the image of the priest in France. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["Priests suffer from a low social status, so we're trying to change that by showing what being a priest really means. A priest has extensive training in philosophy and the humanities. He is not someone who lives apart from society in his own world, but someone who participates," Fonfroide de Lafon says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["A priest accompanies people in the most important moments of their lives," he adds. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The campaign tries to reach out to the public with newspaper inserts and brochures that showcase real priests and their passion for people and humanity. The campaign is also distributing 50,000 postcards in cafes, cinemas and on college campuses specifically aimed at 16- to 22-year-olds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Fonfroide de Lafon says the recent child abuse scandals haven't hurt the campaign, but instead made it more important than ever for the church to show the important work that priests do every day.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[ But in a student center at the Sorbonne, history major Nicolas Dolivera stares skeptically at one of the cards. On it, a smiling young man holds a cardboard cutout of a priest's collar and jacket. A button on the lapel reads "Jesus is my boss" in English. The caption "Why Not?" -- also in English -- is printed across the bottom of the card.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["They're trying to show they're hip by using English words," Dolivera says. "But it's not some slogan or a few flashy colors on a postcard that's going to attract people. The Catholic Church is full of scandals and has to do its mea culpa." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Church officials say they are pleased with the campaign's reception; its Facebook page has had 40,000 visitors already. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Near the university, 21-year-old Maxime Bermann is hanging out with his friends. He has seen the church's campaign on the Internet. But he thinks it will be difficult to draw more young people to the priesthood as long as there are so many arcane rules. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA["[The church] seems to look back to old values that don't mean anything to young people today. They have to show with actions that they are able to modernize and not only with cards," Bermann says.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[I don't care who wins this year's World Series. I doubt it will be the Cubs, in any case. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[I think the enduring highlight of the 2010 season occurred Wednesday night when an umpire named Jim Joyce blew a call that would have given Armando Galarraga of the Detroit Tigers that rarest of achievements, a perfect game: 27 batters up, 27 down. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The last out should have been a ground ball to first base, on which Mr. Galarraga took the throw well ahead of the runner. But Jim Joyce called the runner safe. The contrary evidence on video was immediate and glaring. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Yet Armando Galarraga didn’t fume or spew. He didn't call his lawyer or the players union. He smiled and went back to work, getting one last out to win a one-hit shutout over the Cleveland Indians, while losing what may be his lifetime chance for a perfect game. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[But Jim Joyce looked at video of the play and tearfully told reporters, "I just missed the damn call. ... I took a perfect game away from that kid over there who worked his butt"—and he didn't say butt—"off all night." Then he went into the Tigers locker room to apologize to Armando Galarraga. And Mr. Galarraga told reporters, "Nobody's perfect. I understand. I feel for the guy." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Voices from The Nation to National Review have called on the commissioner of Major League Baseball to intervene and reward Armando Galarraga a perfect game. It doesn't look like he'll do that, but he may consider expanding video reviews in baseball. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[I am among those fans who have opposed using video replays that would slow down the game and make it too serious, by analyzing every pitch like it was the BP oil spill. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[I now think that view is as antiquated as a Sony Walkman. These days, managers and coaches watch replays on laptops in the clubhouse, studying a pitcher's motion or a batter's hitch as intently as CIA analysts looking for al-Qaida hideouts in the mountains of Pakistan. A good umpire's rare mistakes already get replayed over and over on stadium scoreboards, TV and the Web, like video of a stickup on America's Most Wanted. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[So I've come to think that permitting a team to ask for, say, two video replays a game would ensure that they were used sparingly and might save a fine man and umpire like Jim Joyce the humiliation of a wrong call. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Armando Galarraga's great performance won't go into the record books as a perfect game. But the real human grace that both he and Jim Joyce displayed this week -- a pitcher and umpire, as natural adversaries as cats and dogs -- became a portrait of inspiration that's bigger than the fine print in any record books. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Edward Tufte has a big backyard that stretches for hundreds of acres near Cheshire, Conn. Over the years, he's filled that space with giant metal sculptures as big as the trees. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA["I think it was Richard Serra who said that the market for big, outdoor landscape pieces is like the market for Canadian experimental poetry," he says. "So I can never be accused of being market-driven in the art world." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Tufte is an accomplished grand-scale sculptor, but he is perhaps more famous for making charts, graphs and diagrams beautiful. He's been called the "DaVinci of Design" and the "Minister of Information." His books -- with titles like The Visual Display of Quantitative Information -- are widely read by Web architects, scientists and basically anyone else who's interested in presenting data creatively and clearly.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[And, the new edition of Microsoft Office will include a Tufte creation: the "sparkline." It's a small graphic, the size of two short words, which can be embedded in text to depict stock markets or baseball stats. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[If that weren't enough, Tufte has also been recruited by the White House to join the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, to advise and devise ways to track how the $787 billion stimulus package is being spent. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[A Gallery For ET]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[Now, the man known as "ET" has just opened a gallery, ET Modern, in New York City's art district. It showcases some of Tufte's smaller pieces. It has the look of what might be a playroom for children -- if that playroom were at MIT. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Two grinning aluminum fish, each twelve feet long, swim on wires in separate rooms. Tufte says they were crafted as an homage to Rene Magritte's painting of a fish with a sly smile. Another sculpture, called the Lunar Lander, looks like an enormous, playful steel Schnauzer. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA["It's candy-apple red. It's meant to go to the moon, so it should look good," he says. "It's made from scrap metal from the Millstone nuclear power plant, so it glows in the dark." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Tufte says he's not sure he could sell some of the pieces in his gallery. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA["I have a very big problem selling pieces, because I don't want them to leave," he says. "For a long time, I believed that any successful piece was a tremendous luck-out, and that I'd never be able to do it again ... My fellow artist friends, who are serious with me, told me to grow up." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[When The White House Calls...]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Tuft credits the combination of his Midwest and Scandanavian heritage plus an Ivy-league professorship for his attraction to public service. "I sincerely believe that to whom much is given, much one should deliver back," he says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[So when the White House called to ask him how they could make government spending easier to track on websites, he advised them to steer clear of what he calls "chartjunk": graphics that look flashy, but actually conceal or distort information. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["Your metaphor should be: You're reporting," he says. Like Google News or The New York Times. "You're reporting -- that's the model." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[That advice helped shape a website, Recovery.gov, which helps track the use of the stimulus package. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["I'm working on things where people can see immediately the 100 biggest projects, the 100 smallest projects, the 100 biggest medical projects, the 100 smallest medical projects," he says. "So it's a way of -- in one click -- of getting down to the material. And also you can put your zip code in and see the projects." ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[When asked if his work with the government and with information design has any overlap with his art, Tufte says he does see a commonality. In the end, he wants to try and leave things that are forever -- and that "make people see a little differently."   [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[As Americans move about the country this Memorial Day weekend, experts say air travel will increase this summer, despite higher fares, sudden travel surcharges and checked baggage fees.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Aviation consultant Michael Boyd says the combination of more people clamoring for seats on fewer flights will guarantee one thing: "It's going to be uncomfortable up there."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Can't wait? A few deals are still available: bargain flights to Iceland -- so beautiful in summer, when pristine white snows are melted by volcanic ash. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Because I'm on an airplane every few days, I try to remind myself of a few truisms when I encounter delays: ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Airport security measures can seem absurd. Grandmothers with surgical pins in their knees get frisked, while hulking guys who look like Tony Soprano's henchmen are waved into first class. The belt that rings alarms in Syracuse sails through detection devices in Detroit. TSA agents check that the name on your ticket matches your identification, as if they were looking for college-age drinkers, even though terrorists from the 9-11 hijackers to the underwear bomber flew under their own names.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[My family and I were on a flight from Boston where the only passengers stopped for special screening were our 2-year-old and the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[But before you groan, remember: No matter how incisive and clever you think you are, you won't convince a TSA agent -- Bill Clinton couldn't -- that airport security screening is so silly, you should be waved through. Just take off your shoes and smile.   ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Time is money" is now a business plan. Airlines short of money fire staff, raise fares and hope to handle more passengers with fewer people. They save money by making lines and waits longer, making you pay in time for what you may have saved on a fare. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But if you owned an airline -- or even stock in one -- would you give up profits for faster lines?  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Also, the people you're likely to get snippy with if and when your flight is delayed or your luggage is lost are probably the least responsible. You may have missed a meeting, wedding or important rendezvous. Gate agents and crew members have had their wages and pensions cut, seen many of their friends fired and been told to do more things for less money. And now, they have to contend with angry passengers like us.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Finally, keep a sense of proportion. If you board a plane in Newark and get off in Los Angeles six hours later -- or seven or eight hours because of delays -- from a flight that's served only pretzels and water, you might feel hungry, grubby and aggravated. But you've also flown safely across a continent. You can see more places, from the Statue of Liberty to the Great Wall, in just a short time than your grandparents could in a lifetime. Count your blessings -- and take off your shoes.   [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[I am currently embroiled in various e-mail exchanges about Sex and the City 2 with three female friends and colleagues. We all dislike it -- no, dislike isn't the word. We think it's appalling. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The difference is that I, who had a love-hate relationship with the series, find it easy to lob insults, while they feel betrayed. They could live with the first movie, but here comes Sex and the City 2 to turn something that either challenged or inspired them -- or just gave them a blessed escape -- into an all-out drag show with arch one-liners and product placements and almost no emotional heft.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[The Sex and the City dynamic has always been fragile. At its most affecting you could see beyond the materialism and artifice and feel the four female protagonists, Carrie and Miranda and Samantha and Charlotte, fighting for validation -- and connecting with one another via that struggle. They were dissimilar, but that was the point: They didn't threaten one another, they weren't catty in the way that so many female friendships are (falsely) portrayed onscreen. They could empathize but also offer detached and witty perspectives. And Carrie could try to sum it all up in her column.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Now, in Sex and the City 2, there's nothing left but surface. And what a surface: The movie is written and directed by Michael Patrick King, and I can almost hear him cackling as he cooked it up. "Let's start with an over-the-top gay wedding -- with Liza Minnelli marrying the couple! Then we'll send the girls to Abu Dhabi so they can rile up the fundamentalists with their revealing clothes and flagrant sexuality! Then they'll make fun of women in traditional black Muslim garb with lines like 'Certainly cuts down on the Botox bill!' -- but later they'll join these repressed women in campy feminist solidarity! And won't our girls look great swishing around the desert being waited on by smooth young Arab men?" ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Well, no, they don't look great. And with their plastic smiles and their forced gaiety, scene after scene feels cringeworthy. The scene that is actually the best of them takes place at a lunch where Kim Cattrall's Samantha lays out her vitamins and pills, while Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie and Cynthia Nixon's Miranda look on in amazement:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["I'm on the one-a-day Fruity Pebbles plan," Miranda says, eying Samantha's pills.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA["Women our age shouldn't joke about vitamins," replies Samantha. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Women who are not our age shouldn't say 'Women our age,'" says Carrie.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Samantha sighs. "I am leading the way through the menopause maze," she says. "With my vitamins, my melatonin sleep patches, my  Progesterone cream, a touch of testosterone ..."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["She's the hormone whisper," exclaims Carrie.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[At least that scene introduces the theme of aging. The rest of the time Cattrall is wearing skimpy dresses and throwing herself at studly males. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[There is a nominal plot: Since Carrie and Chris Noth's Mr. Big got married, he wants to stay home and watch old movies while she wants to go out. Miranda has troubles with her boss. Charlotte is taxed by motherhood. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[In Abu Dhabi, where they accompany Samantha on a PR trip at the behest of a sheik, Carrie bumps into an old flame, Aidan, and feels a tug. But like every other scene, this one is full of melodramatic gestures, and the director's timing is so bad you can see every joke limping its way toward you from across the desert. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[In a movie in which every entrance is meant to make you cry, "Fabulous!" -- in which Carrie's outfits cost as much as $50,000 -- it's worth saying that the designers and especially the cinematographer have not flattered the actresses. And Sarah Jessica Parker, a good comedian with endearing rocky poise, looks better when she's not swanning around. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[For all the smutty double-entendres, Sex and the City 2 is a pale shade of vanilla -- except for one scene. Cattrall, stuffed in short shorts in an Arab marketplace, has a flurry of hot flashes, drops to the ground, and writhes around moaning, "I have sex, yes! I quite enjoy it!" Samantha's identity is so invested in her audacious sexuality that all the contradictions produce a convulsive fit, a fugue state. The scene pushes the boundaries -- I frankly had to avert my eyes -- but at least it connects with real longing, real desperation in ways that the rest of Sex and the City 2 doesn't come near.

        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Within weeks after the devastating Jan. 12 earthquake, while many other things in Haiti still weren't working, the cockfights resumed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Animal rights activists in the U.S. denounce the activity as cruel and inhumane, but in Haiti, spectators say it's a weekly diversion from their difficult daily lives.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[On a recent afternoon in Croix de Bouquets, just outside Port-au-Prince, about 100 men have gathered in the back of a dusty, empty lot. An old man sitting at a school desk charges 20 gourdes, or about 50 cents, for admission.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[The cockfighting "ring" is actually a concrete square with tiered steps rising on each side.  The paint is peeling off the cement. The sheet-metal roof is rusted and battered.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Joselin de Roger, 68, says it is a great sport. The conflict is between the roosters, not between the men, he says. And in this neighborhood if you grew up and found that your father doesn't know how to raise a fighting cock, de Roger says, then he's not a real father.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[De Roger is cradling a rooster named Woy-Woy, or "Ouch-Ouch," in the crook of his arm. Like many other spectators, de Roger has brought his favorite bird to the event even though his animal isn't going to compete. He keeps a sock over the rooster's head so it doesn't get too excited. Other men tuck the creatures under their shirts against their bare skin to calm them down.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[In a country with so many troubles, de Roger and several other men say this ancient sport is a much-needed distraction. Each week these fights are staged all across Haiti.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[The rules of the cockfight are simple. The bout lasts 30 minutes. The roosters try to kill each other. If one chicken flees or collapses, the other wins.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[These are not muscled, plump roosters; they're wiry, thin birds. As soon as their owners pull off the hoods, the birds fluff out their neck feathers and attack. The birds are vicious, slashing at their opponent's head with their claws and pecking with their beaks. Unlike in some countries, the Haitians don't attach blades to the birds' feet.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[Every time one of the birds lands a hit, the men in the crowd yell. They wave crumpled 100 gourde notes -- worth about $2.50 -- calling out bets.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The roosters jump at each other claws-first. Blood and feathers litter the ring. One rooster's face is severely cut. He starts to wobble as if he might topple over.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Roosters are revered animals in Haiti. They figure prominently in voodoo ceremonies, and in the 1990s, the cock was the proud symbol of priest-turned-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Lavalas party.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Somehow on this afternoon, the battered rooster holds on until the clock runs out. There's jubilation at this result among the spectators. It's as if they've just watched the thrilling finale of a soccer match.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[After the fight, the two roosters are brought over to Belen Edner, the unofficial veterinarian. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Edner cleans the birds' wounds with seawater and massages their chests. The weaker cock collapses, and Edner revives it by blowing a puff of air down its throat. He says the roosters need to rest for at least a month before their next battle.  ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[At times, reaction to these developments seems predictably sectarian. In western Baghdad, Durgham Sabah, a 25-year-old Sunni, says it is obvious what's going on:  Allawi won, but the Shiites are blocking him from forming a government.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["Why is that? Allawi got the most seats, and the constitution says he should form the government," Sabah says. "If Maliki had won, you can bet the government would have been formed in a hurry. What has Maliki done? Four years and we have no security, no jobs, no water, no electricity."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[But as helicopters circle over another corner of the city, 27-year-old Shiite Abu Ali says he is not worried about sectarianism. He was glad to see Maliki's State of Law Party join forces with the Iraqi National Alliance:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA["No, it's not sectarian at all, and the process will go on without sectarianism," he says. "The State of Law and the Alliance are two good blocs. They've allied, and people accept that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[But frustration with political stagnation seems to cross all boundaries, regardless of sectarian affiliation. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["Look, Maliki is similar to Allawi, and Allawi is similar to Maliki. They might as well be brothers," he says. "That's what I feel -- they're both the same. And may God help us."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Hamed says he knows how those frustrated Iraqis feel. He left the country during the worst of the sectarian violence, and would consider leaving again if it weren't for family obligations here.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA["I lost two brothers during the sectarian bloodshed, now there's no one left to raise their kids. I'm in charge of too many orphans," he says. "There are people now just waiting for their kids to finish school exams. I think we'll see a lot more families leave after that."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[As the apprehension on the street mounts, politicians from all factions seem to agree on one thing at least: The serious bargaining to form the next government is only just now beginning. ]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Every spring, as the sun starts to shine, DJs reach for the song "Walking on Sunshine." And since its release 25 years ago this week, just about everyone associated with the song has lived quite well off its success. It was recorded by Katrina Leskanich, and when people used to ask her what she did for a living, she'd say, "I'm a singer in Katrina and the Waves. Oh, never heard of it? You know, 'Walking on Sunshine'?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[After it was released in 1985, Leskanich says, "Walking on Sunshine" became one of those "it's never gonna go away" songs, around the world. Every time the song got played on the radio, it made a little more money. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Tim Lee heads up Tummy Touch Records, Katrina and the Waves' current record label. "Every time a song gets played on the radio, you get, what, a buck, a buck 50," Lee says. "If the song's played 2 million times, as 'Walking on Sunshine' has been, it really adds up."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Leskanich, who had been a dishwasher on an American military base in England, says it was a lot like winning the lottery. She says the band wisely decided to put itself on a salary rather than getting lump sums; she was able to put a down payment on a small house in England and bought a new car. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA["The song became bigger than the group," Leskanich says, "and we did pretty much follow in the wake of its success."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Lightning Doesn't Always Strike Twice]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[After a couple of years, however, the record label wanted another hit, just like "Walking on Sunshine."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA["They thought we were the new Monkees, The Beach Boys," Leskanich says of her former label. "But we weren't even that kind of band. We were cooler. I thought I was Nico from The Velvet Underground. Black turtlenecks, eyeliner, no smiling in photographs ..."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[So the band was dropped, but the money from "Walking on Sunshine" kept coming in. In another wise move, Katrina and the Waves held on to the publishing rights. That's the money that typically goes to the songwriter, in this case the band's guitarist, Kimberley Rew. Lee says Rew shares that money with the rest of the band. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Over the years, the song showed up all over the place: in movies like American Psycho and High Fidelity, and in countless commercials, for everything from diapers to medicine.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[" 'Walking on Sunshine' was the crown jewel in EMI's catalog," says Jarrett Mason, who worked for EMI Publishing from 2004 to 2008. He says that of the roughly 1.3 million songs in EMI's catalog, "Walking on Sunshine" was one of its biggest earners -- and that advertisers would pay $150,000 to $200,000 to use it for one year.  ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["It has that kind of feel-good vibe that can just be applied everywhere," Mason says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[By some estimates, "Walking on Sunshine" has made the band about $1 million per year over the past decade. Rew has written more than 200 songs since then, but he lives off the money from "Walking on Sunshine."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA["If we had more songs which more people knew, that would be so much the better, but basically we're lucky to have one," Leskanich says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The story of Katrina and the Waves did not end well; Leskanich says she was fired in 1998. Lawyers were involved, and she says she no longer gets a share of the money made from "Walking on Sunshine." But she does still sing it.  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Portugal has two healthy cultural obsessions: soccer and the music called fado, the latter of which has attracted fans and practitioners from Lisbon to Brisbane and beyond. Its latest star, fadista Ana Moura, has a new CD out this week; it confirms the enduring appeal of this poetic idiom.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Moura, 30, has taken the baton from her artistic forebears and restored faith in the future of fado, Portugal's lilting answer to the blues. The mournful song form has been around for nearly two centuries, but has always depended on a fresh infusion of contemporary attitude and expression. The title of Moura's new CD, Leva-me aos Fados, means "Take me to a fado house," an invitation you can take her up on this spring as she tours North America.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Moura's physical beauty is undeniable, but her mesmeric appeal radiates from within, even if you don't know a syllable of Portuguese. Her ability to alternately whisper, growl and ring like a silver bell are the hallmarks of a fine singer, not just another pretty face.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Fado -- which means "fate" -- certainly played a part in Moura's artistic odyssey. She was busy cutting a pop album when some musician friends at a local bar urged her to sing a fado. The owner of one of Lisbon's most famous fado houses heard her, and the deal was instantly sealed: She would soon become the genre's latest star, appearing nightly and fast accepted by the older musicians who keep close guard over the music's traditions. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Fado is intimate music, depending for accompaniment on the guitarra Portuguesa, that country's version of a 12-string guitar. Unlike overproduced pop singers, Moura is on her own when it comes to delivering the musical goods. In the song "Aguas Passadas," her voice is sparsely supported, and you can hear her very lungs and lips producing the tones, adding yet another level of palpable humanity and emotion to her art. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[But don't mistake emotionality for mawkishness or woe-is-me self-pity. Fado in the 21st century doesn't mean acquiescence to the darkness that surrounds us; not to Moura. The minor-key sadness of the songs is offset by her light but sure sense of swing and innate high spirits. In fact, in the song "Fado vestido de fado," she sounds downright chipper, proof positive that having the blues needn't mean going down without a fight -- or, for that matter, a smile.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[R. Dwayne Betts is a poet, memoirist and teacher. At 16, Betts pleaded guilty to carjacking and was sentenced to nine years in prison. He is the author of A Question of Freedom: A Memoir of Learning, Survival, and Coming of Age in Prison. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[I remember meeting a guy even younger than I was waiting for a bus to go to prison. I'll call him Rasheed. His voice still carried the cracks and high notes of adolescence, and his smooth face had never seen a razor. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[We were headed to Southhampton Correctional Center in Virginia, where only a dozen of us were teenagers. Our peers were at home waiting on driver's licenses, graduations and proms while we waited for a prison cell.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Rasheed's time was legendary: three life sentences with no chance for parole.  It meant he awoke each morning knowing that one day he would flat-line in a cell.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[In prison, guys told me that Rasheed robbed and raped an old lady. His crime had no explanation. And everyone I ever talked to about it thought it was wild, heinous and unfathomable. Rasheed didn't talk about his charges. And I couldn't look at him without thinking how his sentence would last until his final breath. In the visiting room I caught glimpses of his family and it almost seemed normal -- except that Rasheed, the youngest among them, rarely smiled.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[And in prison, surrounded by the violence, cells and expiring men, he was just a kid. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[There was no meanness about him, just the fragility of someone in the deep end -- arms flailing, unable to swim.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[When I looked at him, I remembered the judge looking down at me -- asking if I understood that my charges carry a possible life sentence. Rasheed wasn't old enough to drive, vote or serve on a jury of his peers. But he was old enough to walk out of a courtroom with a sentence that ends in a casket.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[After I met him, my nine-year sentence for carjacking seemed like a gift.  Everything I did while incarcerated meant something because I could envision a day when I'd be free -- and that day pushed me. Because I had a release date, I recognized that the time was a way for me to improve myself. Seventeen hours each day to read, study and exercise. To think and become a man far different from a 16-year-old boy who pleaded guilty to carjacking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[As teenagers, our lives are impulse and reaction. I am not the same person I was at 16. No one is. Juvenile offenders, who are years away from the maturity and sensibility of a 25- or 30-year-old, need to know that society believes they can be more than their crimes. All any incarcerated minor wants to believe is that life can be more than a series of cell doors. They need to know that we believe rehabilitation is not only possible, but real.

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[In the 1960s and '70s, Cuba's Communist hard-liners viewed rock 'n' roll, American pop music and long hair as signs of moral decadence.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[But some things in Cuba have changed since then. These days, Havana is back in the throes of disco fever.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[A resident of Havana, Ricardo Fragela is a huge, lumbering man with a warm smile and an impressive music collection. His living room is an archive of American pop and rock 'n' roll.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[He holds an autographed CD case as if it were a bar of gold. The pop disco ensemble KC and the Sunshine Band sent it to him from Florida after he wrote a fan letter. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[As a teenager in the late 1970s, Fragela would tune his radio to the faint signals of radio stations out of Miami and Key West. He wrote down Casey Kasem's Top 40 countdown every week, filling entire notebooks.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA["It wasn't illegal to listen to that music," Fragela says. "We were just decent young people, who studied and went to school, and weren't hurting society in any way. We just loved the music."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[More than 30 years later, on a recent Saturday afternoon in the bar of the Karl Marx Theater, a crowd of 100 or so is writhing in the darkness, dancing in choreographed rows like on an episode of Soul Train.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[There's a big disco ball on the ceiling, and music videos pirated from VH1 are playing on a huge TV screen. Kool & The Gang hits like "Get Down On It" and "Celebrate" are pulsing from a wall of speakers.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, at the height of Cuba's post-Soviet economic crisis, Communist authorities opened new discotecas all over the country, mostly to appeal to foreign tourists. The venues were too pricey for most Cubans, and they sat empty for much of the day.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Fragela and his friends had families of their own by then, but their musical tastes hadn't changed. So they persuaded some of the state-run-club managers to hire them as DJs for afternoon dance parties that would appeal to an older, more Cuban clientele. They were dubbed discotembas --  temba is Cuban slang for a middle-aged person who's a bit past his or her prime.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[As disco fan Samira Reyes explains it, temba is more of a term of endearment than an insult. Pot bellies, wrinkles, a receding hairline -- that's temba.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA[The discotembas take place on weekend afternoons, making it easier for parents to get child care. And they are often over by 9 p.m., so it's not hard to get up for work the next day.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Harry Otero is a disco lover -- and a grandfather.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[He says discotembas  are different from the discotecas that play popular salsa and reggaeton music. People are polite enough not to smoke, they don't drink much, and there are no drugs, he says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["We're grandparents now," he says, "so we have to set a good example."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Otero was on the balcony of the Karl Marx discotemba with Ibis Garcia, a 56-year-old actress with heavy eyelashes and tall heels. She said the music makes her nostalgic, and the nostalgia is what keeps her young.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["This music makes me feel young because I am young," Garcia says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA["And there are other things that keep me young, too," she adds with a wink. "Like men. How do you like that answer?"]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[By almost any measure, U.S. Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan was a hugely successful dean at Harvard Law School during her tenure from 2003 to 2009.   ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[So much so that in some ways, the descriptions of Kagan as dean sound a bit like the beginning of the old Superman TV series. Instead of "Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands," the Harvard version might be:]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Kagan, who can raise money by the millions. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Kagan, who can end the faculty wars over hiring.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Kagan, who won the hearts of students, promoted public-interest lawyering, and who, as the first female dean of one  the oldest  law schools in the country ...]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Well, you get the idea.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[She did indeed do all of these things. The controversy that is likely to dominate much of her confirmation hearing -- the school's ban on military recruiters because of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy -- was actually an extension of a policy that existed long before she became dean. It was not enormously controversial on campus, because faculty and student groups had long supported the ban as an anti-discrimination measure.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[Kagan, however, does get lots of credit for putting an end to decades of factional faculty feuding, getting unanimous faculty approval for a new curriculum that sharply broke with the past and changing the grading system.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="9"><![CDATA[Most of all, she wins praise for getting faculty approval to hire an astonishing 22 new tenure-track professors, including some prominent conservatives who had served in the Bush administration.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Greasing The Process]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="11"><![CDATA[President Obama and some of Kagan's admirers have suggested this feat shows her ability to build consensus. But even her supporters concede that her tactic was less consensus-building and more skillfully greasing the process. She did that by building key relationships with faculty members in every ideological camp and then ramming through decisions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="12"><![CDATA["She knocked some heads," says longtime conservative faculty member Charles Fried. "And she made people realize it couldn't go on because we were aging, and we weren't replacing ourselves, and we needed to grow."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA[Liberal Mark Tushnet, recruited from Georgetown Law School, agrees. "My own judgment is that running the place with a fairly heavy hand ... was politically necessary in order to get the faculty to move forward," he says. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[She was a gracious and generous dean. "She celebrated peoples' accomplishments," says Fried. "If somebody wrote a book, she would put on a big conference about it. She'd bring people to do a panel. She'd get students to put up posters."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA[The school was seen as "a much more intellectually vibrant place," says former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, one of Kagan's faculty recruits. "People have told me it's a much happier place, too," he adds.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="16"><![CDATA[Kagan has far more fans than detractors at Harvard, but even they acknowledge she is something of an operator. "Elena is a master pool shark, and we are all the balls she is shooting in the pockets," says one of her fans. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[Some on the left, however, say they stopped going to faculty meetings when she was dean because discussion was truncated and disagreements simply glossed over. "I think she has a political heart. She wants to do good, but she has no soul, no center of gravity, so her heart can move depending on the political moment," says one campus critic who didn't want his name used. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Minorities On Campus]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="19"><![CDATA[While Kagan succeeded in bringing greater ideological diversity to the faculty, she was not nearly as successful in hiring minorities and women. Only 20 percent of the new hires were women, and there was not a single new African-American or Latino tenure-track professor hired.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA["I think that's a very difficult number to explain," says Duke Law professor Guy-Uriel Charles. "So the question then becomes why was that not a priority."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[Harvard's Charles Ogletree, an aggressive civil rights advocate, agrees the numbers are not good. "It's been unfortunate," he says, "but I don't in any way doubt her own commitment to diversity, and I see that in the unprecedented number of students of color that came to Harvard since she was the dean."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Indeed, persons of color made up more than a third of the incoming class by Kagan's last year. What's more, Ogletree says that Kagan recruited minority graduates for fellowships at the school so that they would have a place to think and write and position themselves for tenure-track positions.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA[And he points to the fact that Kagan instituted new and innovative programs to attract students to public interest and government jobs, using stipends and large tuition grants as incentives.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="24"><![CDATA['I Love Dean Kagan']]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="25"><![CDATA[Kagan, in fact, was hugely popular with the students.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="26"><![CDATA["Oh, they loved her," says Ogletree. "In fact, when she did not get appointed as the university president, the students wore T-shirts saying, 'I Love Dean Kagan.'"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="27"><![CDATA[Kagan famously did things to make student life nicer -- everything from providing free coffee and bagels to creating an ice rink.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="28"><![CDATA[Ogletree says Kagan got the rink idea while musing that the school needed to do something to lighten the long, dark winters for students. So she asked the maintenance department to flood the grassy area outside her window, put hay bales around it and put up lights so that students could skate at night, too. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="29"><![CDATA[The jerry-rigged rink soon became a gathering place for skaters and nonskaters alike. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="30"><![CDATA[Kagan made a point, too, of reaching out to students like Carrie Severino. "She, I think, identified some of the conservative student leaders and asked them what kinds of things she could do to help conservatives feel more comfortable on campus," says Severino, who now heads a conservative group in Washington that appears to be  inching toward opposing Kagan. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="31"><![CDATA[The cheerful, charming Kagan so beloved by the students was not always in evidence elsewhere. Secretaries and faculty members alike have stories of Kagan screaming at people, slamming doors and chewing out subordinates in public -- a trait that she is said to have carried with her to her next job as solicitor general. She's a "yeller," concedes one of her friends with a wry smile. ]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="32"><![CDATA[Tushnet, one of her admirers, puts it this way: "Her weakness as dean was that she really didn't like people to disagree with her. But that's not something you can do at the Supreme Court."  [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]]]></paragraph>
